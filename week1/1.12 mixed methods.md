Good quantitative research is underpinned, in many cases, by good qualitative research.

The was once a time where researchers lived in different tribes.  A researcher did either qualitative or quantitative research, and was recognised as such.  In those times, scientists worked with numbers and humanists worked with everything else and the two rarely crossed paths except to argue with one-another.

If those days aren't already over, they are on the way out. There is now much wider recognition on the value of working collaboratively and developing research skills in both areas.

Using a combination of numerical data and stories can give is a very rich and nuanced understanding of people's experiences of a problem, while helping us to comprehensively understand how widespread a problem is, and the things we could do to help us to fix or avoid it.

## Mixed-methods in practise

Take the issue of homelessness.  If you want to know the risk factors associated with becoming homeless or staying homeless, you might be able to get somewhere using quantitative methods.   Similarly, if you want to know what it's like to be homeless and have a full and detailed account of the kinds of difficulties that people who are at risk of becoming homeless face, you'd probably do well to consider 

How do people come to be homeless, why do some stay homeless and what's it like to be homeless?
