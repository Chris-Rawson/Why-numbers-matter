# What do you measure?

## Defining what to measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time considering this question.

Depends on:

* the shape of the research and the dimensions you're trying to prod
* access to data, and therefore
* the resources that you have at your disposal


## Your task

Think back to the research questions that you created in the last step, when we looked at the dimensions of your research problem.

Identify exactly _what_ you would measure, why and how.
