Congratulations for getting this far.  When you think about it, we've been through a lot together this week.

This week has been jam packed!  It's been all about designing quantitative and mixed methods studies.

We've started by discussion why numbers matter and moved onto determining the shape and dimensions of your problem in order to figure out exactly what to measure, and we were introduced to how we can build a picture with the results.

We've also seen that quantitative research can ask exploratory, descriptive or explanatory questions to discover and compare patterns, and what things are related to each other.  We looked at how controlled studies can help us identify the factors that are responsible for what we are observing with some precision, but uncontrolled studies are sometimes more practical or better at telling us what might happen in the real world.

We also looked at the possibilities for mixed-methods research to help us build a highly nuanced understanding of a problem and gives us data sources that can be used to cross-validate one another. 

To top it all off, we used this information to practise designing our own study.
