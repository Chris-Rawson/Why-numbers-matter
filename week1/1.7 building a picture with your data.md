Let the data speak for themselves.

Once you've spent much time around people doing quantitative research, you'll get used to this phrase.  It means two, inter-related, things:

Chris really hoped that Miranda's research would be effective, but he couldn't let this cloud his professional judgment.  If you're trying to curb obesity, it's not worth the struggle of embracing a strategy if the data tells us that raising the price of sugary drinks has no real impact on whether or not people buy it.

So, what did the data tell us?  The headline figures show us that:

* Sales of red (unhealthy) drinks decreased by 27.6% from expectations, based on sales trends.
* Sales of amber drinks decreased by 26.7% 
* Sales of green (healthy) drinks increased by 26.9%

## Your task

Have a look at these diagrams and explain their meaning to us.  What do they tell us about the most effective strategies to target obesity?
