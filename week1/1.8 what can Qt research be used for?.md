# What can quantitative research be used for?

Quantitative research, or empirical inquiry, is used to measure, describe and discover patterns about things.  They help us understand how likely things are to happen in future.

By things, we mean almost anything: physical items, behaviours, changes, movements, growth, thoughts or expressions - and the list could very easily go on.

So long as we can measure them and compare them with things which have similar characteristics, we can undertake quantitative research. Ideally, other researchers should be able to use the same methodology that we have and come up with an identical result, and we should always have a way of finding out if our assumptions are wrong. However this can be impractical in in many cases.  

Quantitative research is therefore often used to explain behaviours, or attempt to predict them based on what's happened in the past.  


We can use quantitative research to find out all kinds of things.  We might ask:

* how to build a bridge that will take enough weight to keep motorists safe, 
* how effective a new medical treatment might be, 
* what is likely to happen to traffic flow if we put in a new highway, 
* how do people in a community typically respond to law enforcement officers?
* whether raising the minimum wage would put people out of work
* what the most effective ways to encourage people to make healthier choices about what they eat and drink are 

and so on.  

## Your task

The potential applications of quantitative research are just about endless.  How could numerical data be used to help you to discover patterns and solve your research problem?
