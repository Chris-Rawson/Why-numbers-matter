# What can quantitative research be used for? [review your task]

Quantitative research is used when we need to measure changes.  

These changes, or variations, could be great or small, physical or social.  Quantitative research can help us understand the magnitude of these changes and help us to make predictions about their consequences.

They could happen naturally or as a result of human intervention.  Traditionally, quantitative research was undertaken to measure physical variables in science, technology, engineering and medicine.  These fields help us to understand and predict physical changes.
Apart from psychology, economics and related fields, few disciplines studied variations that occured in human behaviour as a result of people's experiences. 

Today, quantitative research is well established in education and other studies of society which are sometimes grouped together under headings like social or political sciences.  Increasingly, researchers are finding uses for quantitative research approaches across the Arts and Humanities.  In these fields, quantitative research can hep us understand the consequences of decisions that impact our lived experience.  For example, is there a relationship between our religious beliefs and political views, or how would respond to the redefinition of a state or national border?

## We still need qualitative research

One of the questions that sometimes pops into people's minds is 'why do we still need qualitative research'?  After all, quantitative research can tell us about the world with a greater degree of accuracy, precision and reproducability. 

But there are things worth knowing that we can't find out using statistics.  Trying to do so would be unscientific.

As we saw throughout _Why Experience Matters_, qualitative research is a very powerful way of understanding how we perceive, understand and communicate about the world.  We all tell ourselves powerful stories, grand narratives, to make sense of the world and our place within it.  It's worth remembering that ultimately when we analyse and explain our data we are producing a story too. 

Just like any other story, our interpretation of the results is prone to differ.  What we will do with the results and the decisions we make about them are, like any story, caught up in our experiences of how we understand the world and our place within it.  Unfortunately, some people put little stock in science.

How do you _measure_ variations in people's understanding of the world?  It's not impossible, but the complexity of these understandings and the highly invidual nature of them makes it often a prohibitive task.  Certainly, counting or arranging the distribution of words from an interview - or from a great novel - might not do much to help us to properly understand what they really mean.  And, like interpreting quantitative results, our interpretation of other stories differ too.  You might have a strong idea of why a Grecian Urn might be described as ["Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness!"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44477/ode-on-a-grecian-urn), but your interpretation is likely to be difficult to measure.

This does not make them any less worthy of a researcher's attention. As we learnt during _Why Experience Matters_, we all interpret and communicate stories as individuals and as societies as a way of making sense of the world and our place within it.  These paradigms, or grand narratives, have an exceptionally powerful impact on our thoughts, feelings, beliefs and behaviour. 

## Mixed methods

Quantitative research is great for measuring and comparing variations and qualitative research can get to the heart of the way we experience the world and why we behave the way we do.

In complex situations that involve people's behaviours, using a combination can give us an exceptionally powerful insight into what will happen if we make a change, how people will behave and how others might experience the change.  After all, these things usually depend on another.

For example, we we able to find out that people buy less unhealthy and more healthy drinks if you put up the price of the ones loaded with sugar.  But if we want to know why people chose something when the price went up, or whether or not retailers are willing to do it, we need to know how staff and their customers feel about it.  This is why Miranda and the team at GLOBE asked.
