# What can quantitative research be used for? [review your task]

Quantitative research is used when we need to measure changes.  

These changes, or variations, could be great or small, physical or social.  Quantitative research can help us understand the magnitude of these changes and describe, explore, explain and make predictions about their consequences.

Traditionally, quantitative research was undertaken to measure physical variables in science, technology, engineering and medicine.  These fields help us to understand and predict physical changes.  Apart from psychology, economics and related fields, few disciplines studied variations that occured in human behaviour as a result of people's experiences. 

Today, quantitative research is well established in education and other studies of society which are sometimes grouped together under headings like social or political sciences.  Increasingly, researchers are finding uses for quantitative research approaches across the Arts and Humanities.  In these fields, quantitative research can allow us to understand the consequences of decisions that impact our lived experience.  For example, if we have an idea of the relationship between local biodiversity and how many parklands there are in an area we might be able to predict what will happen if that area is opened for the development of housing.

Some make a distinction between research into natural and social/cultural problems. For example, you might distinguish between a researcher [assessing the accuracy of software](http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30089161) that predicts population numbers of disease carrying mosquitoes and research that looks at whether [crime is reduced in areas where there are strong social networks](http://hdl.handle.net/10072/173029).  Both can be exceptionally complex and contain an unlimited number of things to measure, explain and understand.  They can also be inter-related.  However, we can often be more confident about our analysis of natural problems.




## Your task
Options:

* The potential applications of quantitative research are just about endless.  How could numerical data be used to help you to discover patterns and solve your research problem?
* How do you account for the growth in interest in quantitative research from traditionally qualititative fields, and vice-versa?
