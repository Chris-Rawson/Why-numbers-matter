# What can quantitative research be used for?

Quantitative research, or empirical inquiry, is used to measure, describe and compare and contrast things.  They help us understand how likely things are to happen.

## A little theory, don't mind me.
At its heart, numbers are used to signify or represent things.  In this respect, they are no different in any way to any other form of communication.

What makes numerical data unique is that, in order to function, they _define_ and therefore _standardise_ what counts as one thing and what counts as another as well as what doesn't count at all. This allows us to measure, compare and contrast the things and the characteristics we are interested in on a level playing field.  This is why it's so important to be careful and specific about how we define things, and what we measure.

There's very little that can't be measured at all, but some things might be measured more succesfully than others.  Measuring some things, like the impact or value of a work of art or scholarship, can be an unrewarding task.  This might be because there's too much we don't know (how can we measure the number of planets in a galaxy we can't see?) or the things we are trying to compare are too different, or because our measurements are unlikely to provide an adequate explanation for our observations.

If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that this little bit of theory is really only a summary of what we've discussed so far throughout the course.

## So, what can quantitative research be used for?

Quantitative research can, therefore, be used to describe, compare and contrast things.  This allows us to find patterns that can help to explain how things work and/or predict what might happen in the future.



By things, we mean almost anything: physical items, behaviours, changes, movements or growths, thoughts or expressions - and the list could very easily go on (and on).
