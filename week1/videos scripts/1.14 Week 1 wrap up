Well done on completing the first week of the course.  
We hope you’ve enjoyed taking time out to think about why numbers matter, and how they can help us to make better informed and fairer decisions.

This week, we’ve looked at the potential for quantitative research help us ask a truly enormous range of questions and paint an accurate picture of a problem with numbers.  We investigated the range of methods available to us, and what happens when you move from an environment that you can control and out into the wild.

Finally, we looked at the close relationship between qualitative and quantitative research, and why this is essential for helping us to decide what to measure.  

Join us next week as we finish the course, and explore the application of statistics to solve real world problems.  

See you then.
