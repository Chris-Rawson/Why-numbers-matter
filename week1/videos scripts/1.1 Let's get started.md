# Why do numbers matter? REVISED - RERECORD

Hello, and welcome.  

Throughout this course, weâ€™ll be taking a looking at why numbers matter.  We'll explore the role of numerical data in our research, and how it affects each and every one of us in our day-to-day lives.

Many of us don't sit down and 'do the sums' unless we are faced with a big financial decision. We've grown accustomed to thinking of numbers as the exclusive domain of scientists and mathematicians.

But if you really stop to think about it we use numbers to make decisions every single day.

Questions like 'How much time do you spend with our family or colleagues, what should you eat for dinner, or how should you get to work' are all decided, at least in part, with numbers.

When you consider that everyone in our community is making similar small decisions each and every day, you realise how quickly they add up.

All the while, policy makers and influences are using numbers to help inform decisions that have the potential to affect a great number of people. Numbers can help us understand the effect of planning regulations on the ecosystems in your community, or help governments decide how to spend their limited resources fairly and effectively.

With a bit of application and determination, you will be able to develop the skill to use quantitative research and make evidence-based decisions about the things that matter to us the most.
