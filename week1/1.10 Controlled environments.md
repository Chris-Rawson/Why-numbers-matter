Research in controlled environments, such as a laboratory, can help us to understand how things vary together.

What does a biochemist who looks at how molecules can guard against antibacterial resistance, an architect trying to figure out if a skycraper can withstand a cyclone and an IT developer looking at how people interact with a new user interface have in common?

They're all experimenting to find out what happens to one thing (a dependent variable) when you change another (the independent variable).  We can use this information to find out how two or more 'variables' are related (or 'correlated) to one another.  Variables could be almost anything that research identify and being important to understanding a problem.  It could be measuring physical things like the weight of a car, or the behaviour of living things.  The only criteria for something being considered as a variable is that we can measure its variation.


## What do we mean by 'controlled environment'?

A controlled environment isn't necessarily a laboratory.  It is simply an environment that allows a researcher to control and manipulate the variables that they are interested in.
