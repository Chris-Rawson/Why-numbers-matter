# Research in controlled environments can help us to understand how things vary together.

A controlled environment is one that allows a researcher to control and manipulate the independent variables that they are interested in, and make sure that other variables don't [confound](glossary), or get in the way of, their results.   A chemist would make sure that they have precise control over the way that chemicals mix together.

Outside of a laboratory, this is not always easy.  There might be many things that influence what we're seeing happen, or they might not be possible to control.  The most common way to ensure that we are testing only what we set out to, you could weave [scientific controls](glossary) into your research design. 

Controls are achieved by introducing a second sample which is as close to the other as possible in every respect, except in one you change the independent variable and in the other, you don't.  The control sample then acts like a counterweight to help us understand if what we are observing is really caused by whatever has been changed.

The most famous example of a scientific control is the use of placebos in randomised control trials.  If you're testing whether or not taking a tablet could help people quit smoking, you could give people the tablet and then see if the number of cigarettes they smoke per day reduces.  But this reduction might have happened for any reason - just being part of a trial might be enough.  Introducing a control group who have been given a placebo would mean we could more reliably figure out whether or not taking the table is helping people to cut down on their cigarettes and not other factors.

There are a number of techniques for introducing scientific controls besides placebos.  Having two groups means you can isolate other factors as well, like how fit someone is or how much support they have at home when trying to quit.

## Ethics
Sometimes it would be unethical to test something in a controlled environment.  Using a control group to study the effectiveness of a newly developed contraception might not be the best idea.

## Your task

Imagine that you have been approached to evaluate the effectiveness of a program that teaches children to swim and behave safely and responsibly around water.

How could you set up an ethical trial with an effective control group?
