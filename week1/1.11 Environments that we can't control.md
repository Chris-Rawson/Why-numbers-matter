Research in the field can help us to observe and understand the factors which have the greatest impacts, while understanding the diversity of peopleâ€™s experiences.

You might remember that in _Why Research Matters_ we introduced you to a [controlled study which found that physical warmth promoted feelings of interpersonal warmth](link).  This relied on the ruse of a researcher posing as a passerby with full hands asking the test subjects to hold a warm or iced-coffee while they pressed a button in a lift.  They then filled in a survey asking them how they'd describe some people in a picture.  You guessed it - the people with warm drinks described them in 'warmer' terms than the people who held the iced-coffee.

But would that work [IRL](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/irl)?  You'd need to take it outside of a controlled environment to see.  The experiment would get more messy, there'd be factors that you couldn't control and so in a way we'd be less certain about our results.  But if we saw this happening over and over again when we watched people in their 'natural environment', wouldn't we be _more_ certain?  

It isn't always necessary, possible or helpful to study things in a controlled environment. A natural experiment can help us to discover things as they are in the real world that often could not be achieved in a labority environment.

Take this example, which those of you with especially good memory may also recall appeared during _Why Research Matters_.  A team of international researchers knew of mounting evidence that parents of girls were more likely to get divorced than parents of boys.  However, this evidence had been gathered from a bunch of data testing other things.  So they looked at a 'natural experiment,' or a situation that meets the conditions of an experiment that has occured naturally.

They looked at over two million marriages in Holland over a ten year period, and found that [there was indeed around a 5% greater risk of girl's parents getting divorced](https://theconversation.com/parents-of-teenage-daughters-more-likely-to-divorce-study-84704) if they had a 15-year-old daughter, compared to a son.  They also found that this risk disappeared if the girl's father grew up with a sister.  

While it was, of course, not possible to say with absolute clarity why this was the case the researchers still tested a number of theories that had been put forward about why a child's gender is associated with their parents likelihood of being divorced.  The researchers thought the most likely explanation was that in some households where fathers held very traditional views on gender roles, this strained the relationship with parent's mothers.
