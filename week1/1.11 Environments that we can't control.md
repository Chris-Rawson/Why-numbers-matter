You might choose to undertake research in an uncontrolled environments if controlling the environment is not really an option, may be unethical or if it would make you less certain about your results.

## Practicality

Sometimes we don't have the knowledge or it would be impractical to introduce a control group.

It's hard to know what to control if we don't really know why something's happening.  In many cases we still need [descriptive research](glossary link) to help us identify the factors that we could eventually control against. For example, if you want to know how to get kids interested in football, you might need to [look at the factors that influence their participation](http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30002850).  

Sometimes it's just not practical to introduce a control group because of the amount of resources involved.  If you're looking at the impact of a proposed change to roads in your local area, you're not very likely to convince anyone in your council to trial a change just to see what happens.  

In these cases, natural experiments can often be helpful.  For example, Dr Jenny Veitch from Deakin University used a natural experiment to see if [improving parks into local areas led to more people using them to exercise](http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30065182).    


## Certainty

Research in the field can help us to observe and identify things in their natural setting, and identify the factors which have the greatest impacts.  Controlled environments are very good at letting us isolate variables, like holding a hot or cold drink.  But because life happens outside of a controlled environment, watching things in their natural setting can be enlightening.  

You might remember that in _Why Research Matters_ we introduced you to a [controlled study which found that physical warmth promoted feelings of interpersonal warmth](link).  This relied on a ruse.  A researcher posed as a passerby with their hands full of books, files and a hot or iced-coffee.  They asked the people who were about to do the test to hold their coffee while they pressed a button in an elevator.  Afterwards, the people felled in a survey asking them how they'd describe some people in a picture.  You will probably remember that the people with warm drinks described them in 'warmer' terms than the people who held the iced-coffee.

But would that work in real life, and if it does, is it really _that_ important to our feelings towards someone? Aren't there a whole lot of things that change the way we feel towards someone when we first meet them?  And what would happen if we met a real person rather than an image?  How would we express our feelings without a survey in front of us?  

Finding this out would be messy.  In a controlled environment, we can regulate the temparature of the coffee or the elevator, show people the same picture and give them the same survey.  If we simply observed people interacting in a variety of different locations where they might have hot or cold drinks, things would be more messy and we couldn't be as sure about our results.   But if we observed people holding a cup of warm coffee over and over again when they make new friends in their 'natural environment', wouldn't we be _more_ certain?  Perhaps it's a different kind of certainty.

## Ethics
Sometimes using control groups can be unethical.  You would never trial a new form of contraception by giving one group a placebo.  

You also need to think very carefully about the potential consequences of being in or out of a control group. A trial that looks at the effectiveness of a new way of teaching students might help a lot of people down the line, but what about the people who aren't taught in a way that could benefit them?

The ethics of any controlled trial is something that needs to be carefully considered.  We'll take a closer look at this during _Why Ethics Matter._
