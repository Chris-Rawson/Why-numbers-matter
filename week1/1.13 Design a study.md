How would you uncover what you need to know to solve a problem?

This week we've looked at developing quantitative and mixed-methods studies, using problems relating to drinking too much sugar or people experiencing financial hardship to explore the meaning behind numerical data.

We did this as a way of exploring how numerical data can be used to build a rich understanding of the problems that we all have some responsibility in facing up to.  That, far from the stereotype of quantitative research (and researchers) as being cold and somehow dehumanising, numerical data can be incredibly meaningful and insightful, and quantitative researchers altruistic.

## Your Task

It's time to harness some of your own altruism and desing a quantitative or mixed methods research study.  

Identify a problem in your community and design a study.  Your study design must tell us:

* What the problem is, and why it matters
* How you will determind the shape and dimensions of your problem
* What you will measure, and
* How you will analyse what you've measured
* Whether you will use a controlled or uncontrolled environment

Leave your study design in the comments.
