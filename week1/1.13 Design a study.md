How would you uncover what you need to know to solve a problem?

Quantitative research builds a rich understanding of the problems that we all have some responsibility in facing up to.  We need quantitative research to help is ensure our families, workplaces and communities become healthier, greener, more inclusive and efficient.  

This week we've looked at how to understand the shape and dimensions of a problem can help us to figure out what to measure and build a picture of our sample.  We've also looked at what quantitive research can be used for and the types of questions we'd usually ask, when to use a controlled or uncontrolled environment and when to used mixed methods.



## Your Task


Now's the time to put this intro practice by designing a quantitative or mixed methods research study. 

Identify a problem in your community and outline a research project that could help to solve it.  Your study design must tell us:

* 1) What the problem is, and why it matters
* 2) How you will determind the shape and dimensions of your problem
* 3) Whether you will use an controlled environment or mixed methods
* 4) What you will measure, and
* 5) An indication of how you will analyse what you've measured
 
Leave your study design in the comments.

We will revisit this task next week, which will give you an opportunity to reflect further on what you have learnt and how it has built on your learning from this week.
