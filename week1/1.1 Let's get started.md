# Why do numbers matter?

Hello.  Welcome to 'Why numbers matter.'

In this course, we'll explore the role of numerical data in our research, and how they effect each and every one of us in our day-to-day lives.  

Some of us have grown accustomed to thinking of numbers as the exclusive domain of scientists and mathematicians, or don't sit down and 'do the sums' unless we are faced with a big financial decision.  But if you really stop to think about it we use numbers to make decisions every single day for everything from deciding how much time to split between our family and our colleagues, to what to eat for dinner, to whether we'll take the car or the bus to work. When you consider that everyone in our community is making similar small decisions each and every day, you realise how quickly they add up.

Throughout the course, we'll help you to use numbers to make better informed decisions to help solve problems.  We will look at making valid and reliable measurements, describing the characteristics of what is being measured, and exploring if there is a relationship between them.

No matter who you are, you are capable of using numbers to make better informed and fairer decisions to help improve your well-being, workplace and community.
