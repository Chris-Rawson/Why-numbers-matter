# Why do numbers matter?

Hello.  Welcome to 'Why numbers matter.'

This course will help you to understand the role of numerical data in research and in our everyday lives. 

[There are very few decisions or questions in life that can't be informed by numbers.  Numbers must be informed by Ql research. Case study approach.  Appeal to stay through the course even if you don't like numbers because you'll a) learn something useful b) improve your confidence c) find out it's not so hard after all].

Even if you think you're not a 'numbers' person, this course will help you to understand the power of numbers to better understand your problem and make more informed decisions.

Throughout the course, we'll look at how to decide what to measure and how and what that tells us about what is normal and what is unusual.  We'll also look at whether there is a relationship between different measurements.
