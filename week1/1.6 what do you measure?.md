# What do you measure?

## Defining what to measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time considering this question.  In some cases, discovering what can be measured and how is a research project on its own [find and link to example].

Defining what to measure will depend on the shape and potential dimensions of your problem, and your ability to measure it.  Being able to measure something is often a pragmatice problem, which can come down to having access to reliable data or equipment.




## The shape and dimensions of your research                                                                                                                                          
In rare cases, knowing what to measure is simple.  you might have some practical issues measuring the average height of a dwelling in your suburb, but at least it's not so difficult to figure out what to measure.

However, even something simple can be more complex than this, and require some pragmatism.

In our previous example, we looked at a project which sought to measure the impacts of stocking vending machines with healthy snacks.  This projects sounds straightforward enough until you start to think about how we define 'healthy snacks' or 'impacts' and consider what's involved in measuring it.

To measure what would happen if you put healthy snacks in a vending machine, you need access to the machines and suppliers who are willing to participate in the experiment.  In this case, 37 vending machines were in three hospitals which are funded and regulated by the same government.

This context had some influence over the next basic question: 'how do you define healthy food?'  The researchers were able to rely on [policy guidelines](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/about/publications/policiesandguidelines/healthy-choices-guidelines-public-hospitals) produced by the State Government.  Using these guidelines meant that the researchers had an evidence-based system for deciding what food was, or was not, healthy that people would find easy to understand and which would allow the hospital to comply with a government policy.  There is also a great deal of prior research underpinning the guidelines.

Of course, the researchers can't plan to measure _every_ potential impact, either because it's not practical to do so or because we don't always anticipate the consequences.  Researchers used qualitative methods to try and understand what the people in the hospital learnt during the trial.  They discovered that suppliers were willing to change their practises on request, but that there was some way to go before a supply chain was in place to supply a large and appealing range of healthy snacks to the machines.  This information could be used to build the foundations of a further quantitative study.

## Access to the data

Can you actually get hold of the data you need?

This can be a question about relationships just as much as it can be about equipment.  

In real world research, you're often playing on someone elses turf, so you need to play by their rules.  You can't find out what will happen if you put health food in a vending machine in a lab.

[In our case study, Kathryn and her co-researchers had a prior relationship with the hospitals and knew some of the people involved quite well.  In your own research, you need to ensure that you have a strong enough relationship with the people or organisations involved in the project to withstand some potentially difficult moments.  This will probably require some flexibility in both direction.

For example, the hospitals needed to establish a relationship with a supplier who was prepared to provide them with healthy snacks and data on their sales.  While they found a supplier thought a competitive tender process, the interview participants reported that working with the successful bidder allowed them to educate their staff on nutrition.]


## Your task

Think back to the research questions that you created in the last step, when we looked at the dimensions of your research problem.

Identify exactly _what_ you would measure and how you would gain access to the required data.
