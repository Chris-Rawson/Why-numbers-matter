# What do you measure?

## Defining what to measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time figuring out what to measure.  In some cases, [discovering new ways to measure things](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138660) is a research project in and of itself.

Knowing what to measure often seems simple until you go out to do it.  It's at that point that you'll realise, if you haven't thought about it earlier, that you will need very clear rationale for why you're measuring something, definitions of what you are measuring and a method for doing so.  It's a question of precision and practicality.

## Precision

When the GLOBE team set out to measure if raising the price of unhealthy drinks would encourage people to choose something a bit more healthy, they needed to know _exactly_ what they were measuring.  How do you decide what's a healthy drink?  And how much should the price go up, exactly?





## Access to the data

There's no point defining something for measurement if you can't actually get the data you need.

This can be a question about relationships just as much as it can be about equipment.  

In real world research you're often playing on someone elses turf, so you need to play by their rules.  You probably can't find out anything all that meaningful about young people's study habits in a lab.  

If you plan to ask young people to keep a record of the amount of time they spent doing homework and then see if it helped them get better test results, you'll need to have good elationships with Schools, teachers, parents and children. 

If you wanted to observe students behaviours when using visiting a specific site or system online, you will need to work with the site's owners too see what data they'd share with you.  And that's _before_ you consider any potential ethical issues with doing so.



## Your task

Imagine you are working on figuring out how young people could develop effective study habits.  

Come up with a strategy to help you define and measure 'effective study habits' and gather the data required to do so.
