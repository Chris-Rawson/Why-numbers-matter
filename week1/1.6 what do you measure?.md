## Defining what you should measure measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.  But it depends on what you _can_ measure.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time figuring out what to measure.  In some cases, [discovering new ways to measure things](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138660) is a research project in and of itself.

Knowing what to measure might seem simple at first, but in reality it can be a complicated business. In this step, we'll look at what makes something measurable.


## Measurable

If we have no practical way of measuring something then we really can't keep track of how it varies.  The challenge of measuring physical things tend to be practical.  If you're observing a colony of emperor penguins on Antartica, you're going to have to figure out how to get yourself and your instruments there and back safely.  If you want to know how many bottles of softdrink were sold, you're going to need the shop owners to agree to hand over the data.

With social changes, this can be a theoretical problem.  If we want to know how people young people will respond to an online campaign about respecting people's rights regardless of who they are and where they come from, do we measure how many people have looked at it, how long they've spent online looking through information or do we include a survey asking people how their attitudes have changed?

## Falsifiable

[Falsifiability](link to glossary) means that we need to be able to make a prediction about what will happen in something is changed and we must be able to find out if the prediction is wrong.  This is why we need a __hypothesis__ and a __null__ hypothesis, which we'll look during Week 2. 

It is called falsifiability because we never know for sure if something will always change in the way that we predicted.  We only know that it behaved as predicted when we tested it under specific conditions.  In other words, we can prove a prediction is sometimes wrong but never that it is always right.

This is why we become more confident in our results if they are [__reproduced__](link to glossary) in other settings.  It is therefore important that we set up our experiments in a way that others can reproduce them if they want to, to see that it holds true.  An honest researcher will [let people know if their published results](http://retractionwatch.com/2017/12/05/definitely-embarrassing-nobel-laureate-retracts-non-reproducible-paper-nature-journal/#comment-1528078) are not reproducable.


## Variable

You can't measure things that never vary.

This may sound strange to begin with because so much of what we measure is more or less constant.  But we are not talking here about the boiling point of water or the diametre of the earth so much as we are talking about the heat of water and the size of planets.  

Measuring variation is essential to understanding how widespread a characteristic is, figuring out what is normal and discovering relationships between things, and determining cause and effect.  It is therefore essential that the variables that you measure have been chosen with care.

Variables are usually described as being either [__dependent__ or __independent.__](glossary).  These labels describe the variables relationship to each other.  A dependent variable will vary _because_ the independent variable does.
