# What do you measure?

## Defining what to measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time considering this question.

Depends on:

* the shape of the research and the dimensions you're trying to prod
* access to data, and therefore
* the resources that you have at your disposal

So you need to be careful about how you define what you measure.  Eg, if you think people buy too much coke because they're young and their friends do it, you need to define what you mean by young, and what 'doing it with their friends' means in a way that is actually measureable. 

## Your task

Think back to the research questions that you created in the last step, when we looked at the dimensions of your research problem.

Identify exactly _what_ you would measure, why and how.
