# What do you measure?

## Defining what to measure is a foundational step in any quantitative research project.

Researchers can spend a good deal of time considering this question.  In some cases, discovering what can be measured and how is a research project on its own [find and link to example].

Defining what to measure will depend on the shape and potential dimensions of your problem, and your ability to measure it.  Being able to measure something is often a pragmatice problem, which can come down to having access to reliable data or equipment.


## The shape and dimensions of your research                                                                                                                                          
In rare cases, knowing what to measure is simple.  you might have some practical issues measuring the average height of a dwelling in your suburb, but at least it's not so difficult to figure out what to measure.

However, even something simple is likely to be more complex than this. Figuring out what to measure is about drawing pragmatic boundaries.  This will mean coming up with clear definitions based on an assessment of what measures are achievable.

If you're planning on measuring the study behaviour of young people, you'll need to define _exactly_ what you mean by 'young people' and how you'll group them together for your analysis.  For example, do you measure six-to-ten year olds as a group, or should six year olds be a separate groups to seven-year-olds?  Your analysis is likely to be less arduous if you group in bigger chunks, but it might also be less accurate.  Your qualitative observations should help: if you've noticed significant differences between the way a six-year-old and a 10-year-old studies, then it might not be best to group them together.

Then there's the question of study habits, which we'll look at again in a moment.

## Access to the data

There's no point defining something for measurement if you can't actually get the data you need.

This can be a question about relationships just as much as it can be about equipment.  

In real world research you're often playing on someone elses turf, so you need to play by their rules.  You probably can't find out anything all that meaningful about young people's study habits in a lab.  

If you plan to ask young people to keep a record of the amount of time they spent doing homework and then see if it helped them get better test results, you'll need to have good elationships with Schools, teachers, parents and children. 

If you wanted to observe students behaviours when using visiting a specific site or system online, you will need to work with the site's owners too see what data they'd share with you.  And that's _before_ you consider any potential ethical issues with doing so.



## Your task

Imagine you are working on figuring out how young people could develop effective study habits.  

Come up with a strategy to help you define and measure 'effective study habits' and gather the data required to do so.
