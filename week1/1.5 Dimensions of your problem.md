# The dimensions of your problem

Quantitative research helps us to measure the dimensions of a problem.

Once we have an idea of the shape of our research problem, we need to set about figuring out its dimensions.

In the last step, we looked at how a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods can be used to figure out the shape of your problem.  In other words, how would you characterise your problem?

However, studies which ask people a set of questions in detail to figure out what's going on, or closely observe behaviour, are almost always small in scale as doing this on a larger scale is often not feasible with the resources that we have.

That means, we've absolutely got to figure out how prevalent these insights are, and confirm them with the numbers.
