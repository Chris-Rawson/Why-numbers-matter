# The dimensions of your problem

Quantitative research helps us to measure the dimensions of a problem.

Once we have an idea of the shape of our research problem, we need to set about figuring out its dimensions. 

In other words, if we've figured out that something might be an issue that needs attention to help solve a bigger problem, we need to know how common the issue is.  

For example, how many people consume fizzy drinks?   Of the people who do, how many drink sugary drinks once in a blue moon, and how many drink one or more every day?

When Miranda Blake discovered that one of the top selling items in a convenience store in a hospital was softdrink, she could easily guess that the problem wasn't that people didn't know the harm they were putting themselves in the way.  After all, they work _in a hospital_ and see the impacts of health problems related to obesity every single day.  

The evidence told Ms Blake and her team that people drank it because it was cheap and it was easy.  So what would happen if healthy drinks were cheaper and just as easy?  Ms Blake set up a team to help her find out what would happen if a convenience store put up the price of sugary drinks.  less people buy them and would they buy healthy drinks instead, or would the store just lose sales?  How would staff and customers respond?

In other words, they wanted to know if price _really is_ one of the main things that most people take into their decision making process to when they buy a drink?  


### Your task

What _other_ factors might you take into account to help curb the sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in a hospital convenience store?

How would you find out if they're common or relatively rare?
