Let the data speak for themselves.

That's a common statement in research circles.  It means that once we've collected all of our measurements, a researcher's job is to arrange them into an accurate picture.


We've already seen how numbers can be used to help us understand:

* how people will respond if we increase the price of sugary drinks,
* what would happen if you offered healthy food choices in a hospital vending machine,
* how people's socio-economic status (class) influences what they eat and drink.

Once we have defined what we are measuring, and made the measurements, it's __vital__ that we let the data speak for itself.  That is, to analyse the data in a way that doesn't presuppose or suppress the outcomes or mislead others.  

No matter how much we might 



Without gathering this data, we are unlikely to be able to pinpoint the most effective strategies to encourage people to make healthier choices.  






People sometimes say that numbers are abstract or even dehumanising, but the truth is that most of the time the numbers are used to build a picture of how we can make better informed decisions about how we see and interact with the world.
