# Why do numbers matter? 

## We use numbers to help us make decisions every day.

Think for a moment about the range of decisions that you made over the last few days. 

Most decisions are made without our realising it, but the ones that stand out are the ones we stopped to think about.

On any one day, millions of people just like you are making millions of these decisions every day.  So, the impacts of our decisions can scale up quickly.  

And then there are the really big decisions.  These are the ones that could affect millions of people, and are made on our behalves by community or business leaders, or elected representatives.  What are the goods and services that are offered? Which film or exhibition should be commissioned? What are the safety standards for the roads that get us to and from where we need to go, or the medicines we take? How much should governments spend on education compared to health care or tax cuts? What resources should be supplied for the provision of education? Which film or exhibition should be commissioned? 

## Why numbers matter

Numbers are an incredibly powerful tool to help us make informed judgments and understand how they might affect others. 
[Real word example demonstrating the importance of sampling, describing chatacteristics and a relationship between belief and action].

## Your task

How can numbers help to inform and improve the judgements we make in our everyday lives, and the quality of the decisions that leaders in business and government make on our behalves?  Leave your response, with examples, in the comments section.
