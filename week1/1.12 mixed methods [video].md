Good quantitative research is underpinned, in many cases, by good qualitative research.

The was once a time where researchers lived in different tribes.  A researcher did either qualitative or quantitative research, and was recognised as such.  In those times, scientists worked with numbers and humanists worked with everything else and the two rarely crossed paths except to argue with one-another.

If those days aren't already over, they are on the way out. There is now much wider recognition on the value of working collaboratively and developing research skills in both areas.

Using a combination of numerical data and stories can give is a very rich and nuanced understanding of people's experiences of a problem, while helping us to comprehensively understand how widespread a problem is, and the things we could do to help us to fix or avoid it.  It also has the advantage of letting us see if two different forms of data paint a similar picture, which might tell us that our results are more valid.

## Mixed-methods in practise

Take the issue of homelessness.  If you want to know what puts you at risk of becoming homeless, you might be able to get somewhere using quantitative methods.  Similarly, if you want to know what it's like to be homeless and have a detailed account of the kinds of difficulties that people who are at risk of becoming homeless face, you'd probably consider a qualitative approach.

But if you want to know both, you need to mix your method up.  

[This is something like the problem that Thompson & Bridier (2013) faced when looking into the problem of homelessness in war veterans in the United States of America. They wanted to know what homeless war veterans need to meet their needs and aspirations for the future?

Research showed veterans living in poverty, of who come from an ethnic minority, are three times more likely to become homeless than people in the same situation who are not war veterans.  This problem becomes especially acute after the veterans reach 51 years of age.  
The authors developed an exploratory study to find out where it might be most beneficial to focus our research effort in future.

They used a standardised survey to discover veteran's participant's demographics, how long they'd been homeless and served in the military, their physical and mental health and the goods and services they said they needed.  The surveys they gave care providers described their characteristics, and assessed their perceptions of the whether the services they delivered were meeting needs and were well-cordinated.  
The then used interviews to ask veterans about their life experiences, their experiences of military services, their needs and their hopes for the future.  

As a result, they were able to identify the most pressing needs for the veterans when taking into account the veteran's expressed desires, their characteristics (such as their health or employable skills) and the care that homeless services were providing.  Using mixed-methods allowed them to verify these results by [triangulating](http://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/186156?path=/bmj/341/7783/Research_Methods_Reporting.full.pdf) between  data sources.

And, because they used a standardised test, they were able to compare these results between people living in different locations at different times.

## Your task

Thompson & Bridier (2013) were able to list [the most pressing needs of homeless veterans](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2013/570407/tab2/).  Choose one of these needs and propose a mixed-methods study to help us develop a better understanding of the problem.
