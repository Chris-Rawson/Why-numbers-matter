Good quantitative research is underpinned, in many cases, by good qualitative research.

The was once a time where researchers lived in different tribes.  A researcher did either qualitative or quantitative research, and was recognised as such.  In those times, scientists worked with numbers and humanists worked with everything else and the two rarely crossed paths except to argue with one-another.

If those days aren't already over, they are on the way out. There is now much wider recognition on the value of working collaboratively and developing research skills in both areas.

Using a combination of numerical data and stories can give is a very rich and nuanced understanding of people's experiences of a problem, while helping us to comprehensively understand how widespread a problem is, and the things we could do to help us to fix or avoid it.

## Mixed-methods in practise

Take the issue of homelessness.  If you want to know what puts you at risk of becoming homeless, you might be able to get somewhere using quantitative methods.  Similarly, if you want to know what it's like to be homeless and have a detailed account of the kinds of difficulties that people who are at risk of becoming homeless face, you'd probably consider a qualitative approach.

But if you want to know both, you need to mix your method up.  

This is something like the problem that Thompson & Bridier (2013) faced when looking into the problem of homelessness in war veterans in the United States of America. They became aware of research that showed that veterans who live in poverty or come from ethnic minorities are three times more likely to become homeless than people in the same situation who are not war veterans.  This problem becomes especially acute as the veterans get older.

The authors set out to develop an exploratory study to find out where it might be most beneficial to focus our research effort in future.
