Good quantitative research is often underpinned by good qualitative research, and vice versa.

Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data can give us a rich and nuanced understanding of people's experiences of a problem, while helping us to comprehensively understand how widespread a problem is, and the things we could do to help us to fix or avoid it.  It also has the advantage of letting us see if two different forms of data paint a similar picture, which might tell us that our results are more valid.

The was once a time where researchers lived in different tribes.  A researcher did either qualitative or quantitative research, and was recognised as such.  In those times, scientists worked with numbers and humanists worked with everything else and the two rarely crossed paths except to argue with one-another.

If those days aren't already over, they are on the way out. There is now much wider recognition on the value of working collaboratively and developing research skills in both areas. 

## The value of qualitative research

As we saw throughout _Why Experience Matters_, qualitative research is a very powerful way of understanding how we perceive, understand and communicate about the world.  We all tell ourselves powerful stories, grand narratives, to make sense of the world and our place within it.  These paradigms have an exceptionally powerful impact on our thoughts, actions, feelings, beliefs and behaviour. 

However, they can be difficult to measure.  These kinds of interpretations of the world are singular in nature.  They are highly personal, and they are not often expressed numerically.  Even if they are, sometimes we can have wildly different interpretations of exactly the same thing.


## Mixed methods

Quantitative research is great for measuring and comparing variations and qualitative research can get to the heart of the way we experience the world and why we behave the way we do.

In complex situations that involve people's behaviours, using a combination can give us an exceptionally powerful insight into what will happen if we make a change, how people will behave and how others might experience the change.  After all, these things usually depend on another.

Take the pervasive issue of homelessness.  If you want to know the services and care that people living in homeless communities are most in need of, you need to ask them what their needs and aspirations are for the future and figure out whether the services in place are effective.  Only mixed methods could give us detailed insights that we need to do this.

According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, US war veterans who live in poverty or come from an ethnic mintority, are [three times more likely to become homeless](http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/#faq) than people in the same situation who are not.  

Thompson & Bridier (2013) fac wanted to know what homeless war veterans need to meet their needs and aspirations for the future and how effectively they were being provided for.

They used a standardised mixed methods survey to discover veteran's participant's demographics, how long they'd been homeless and served in the military, their physical and mental health and the goods and services they said they needed.  T

They also used a mixed methods survey for care providers to describe their services and characteristics, and assessed their perceptions of the whether the services they delivered were meeting needs and were well-cordinated.  

Finally, they interviewed homeless war veterens about their experiences of life, military service, needs and hopes for the future.  

As a result, they were able to identify the most pressing needs for the veterans when taking into account the veteran's expressed desires, their characteristics (such as their health or employable skills) and the care that homeless services were providing.  Using mixed-methods allowed them to verify these results by [triangulating](http://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/186156?path=/bmj/341/7783/Research_Methods_Reporting.full.pdf) between  data sources.

And, because they used a standardised test, they were able to compare these results between people living in different locations at different times.

## Your task

Thompson & Bridier (2013) were able to list [the most pressing needs of homeless veterans](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2013/570407/tab2/).  Choose one of these needs and propose a mixed methods study to help us develop a better understanding of the problem.
