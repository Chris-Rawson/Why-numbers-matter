# The shape of your research problem will help you to determine the strategies you investigate to help solve it.

The world is a complex, interconnected place.  Think about something as basic as what determines the way we spend our free time.  This will depend on what we are interested in and what we enjoy, which might depend on how we were brought up, which teachers inspired us in school or our natural dispositions.  In turn, these depend on any number of social, political and biological factors.   Almost everything is connected.

However, unless you're an astrophysicist, you will probably never work on a sample including an entire universe. As researchers, we rely on the ability to break a problem down into its composite parts, so that we can solve problems incrementally.  That means that finding out and demarcating the shape of _your_ research problem in the first step.

Eventually, thinking about the shape of your problem will determine which strategies you could test to help us better understand and ultimately to solve it. 

Initially, however, it will help you figure out to count and measure.

## The big picture

Chris Stevenson works as part of a team at Deakin University's [Global Obesity Centre](http://www.deakin.edu.au/cphr/our-research/global-obesity-centre).  

Obesity has emerged as a [major health problem globally](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/).  Despite being preventable, it is a major contributor to premature deaths all around the world.

Tackling a problem of this magnitude will require us to implement and evaluate a wide range of strategies.  At GLOBE, researchers work on monitoring associated health risks associated with obesity and working with communities and policy makers to implement strategies to deal with the problem.

## Narrowing your focus

One of the problems Chris Stevenson is working on is how to encourage people to make healthier choices about what to drink.

Consuming too much sugar in our drinks is also [an international problem](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845). The over consumption of sugary drinks such soft drink or soda, fruit juice and 'energy drinks' is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Singh et. al. 2015).  

Before we can begin to craft effective strategies to encourage people to make better choices, we need to begin to build a picture of its characteristics.  This will help us see if we can identify how many people are drinking too many sugary drinks and what they have in common.   Finding this out will almost certainly require a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods.  


## Isolating a strategy

Once you know a bit about the common reasons that people say they choose sugary drinks, it's time to look at one of the factors that you think you could do something about.

For example, when researcher Miranda Blake saw evidence that people drank sugar-sweetened beverages because they're cheap and convenient, she worked with the team at GLOBE to find out what would happen if they asked a convenience store to raise the price a bit.  Would it effect sales?  What would people think?


### Your task

Search online for data on the consumptions of sugar sweetened beverages in your locality. If you can't find any, use either these [international figures](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845), or  figures from [Australia](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features7102011-12) or the [United Kingdom](www.google.com).

Once you have this data, come up with one or two  questions that could help you to understand the shape of your problem.
