# Quantitative and qualitative research are two sides of the same coin

Strong quantitative research is increasingly underpinned by both what's been discovered using qualitative methods. 

One of the enduring challenges of quantitative research is _defining_ the shape of your problem so that you can come up with a research question that will give you a useful answer.  To do that, you need to have an idea of the characteristics of what you are studying, what you want to know about it and what you can measure to help you to find out.

Let's look at each in turn.

## The characteristics of what you are studying

Chris Stevenson is a biostatistician in population health, meaning he researches ideas about the policies, treatments or behaviours that could help us become more healthy as a community.  One of the problems he's working on is how to encourage people to make healthier choices of beverages.  

Consuming too much sugar in our drinks is [an international problem](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845). The over consumption of sugary drinks such soft drink or soda, fruit juice and 'energy drinks' is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Singh et. al. 2015).  

Before we can begin to craft effective strategies to combat the problem, it would help to understand its characteristics.  What do the people who drink too much sugar-water have in common?  What reasons can we observe, or they suggest, for their doing so?  

## What you want to know about it

It's only when we've asked both qualitative and quantitative questions about the characteristics of the problem that we can begin to design an effective quantitative study.  If, for example, young people suggest that they drink it because it is cheap and convenient, you might want to know what would happen if healthier options are made more accessible and at a cheaper price.

## What can you measure
This is where we need to make some choices about what to measure.  

You will need to define what you mean by young people, the geographical boundaries of the area that you are interested in and what's meant by both 'cheap' and 'convenient.'  

Then there's the question of access to data.  If you define 'young people' as anyone aged under 25, you will need some means of determining a person's age. Similarly, if you define 'convenience' as a high number of retailers in the area with sugary drinks, you'll need some way of finding that out.  

We'll look at some of the ways we can overcome these challenges to create a feasible study design in much greater detail when we look at planning your research.

### Your task

Search online for data on the consumptions of sugar sweetened beverages in your locality. If you can't find any, use either these [international figures](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845), or  figures from [Australia](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features7102011-12) or the [United Kingdom](www.google.com).

Once you have this data, come up with:

* one quantitative research question, and
* one qualitative research question  

that could help you to build a broader and more comprehensiver understand of these figures.
