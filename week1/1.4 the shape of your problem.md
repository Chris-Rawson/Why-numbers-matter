# Quantitative and qualitative research are two sides of the same coin

Strong quantitative research is increasingly underpinned by both what's been discovered using qualitative methods. 

One of the enduring challenges of quantitative research is _defining_ the shape of your problem so that you can come up with a research question that will give you a useful answer.  To do that, you need to have an idea of the characteristics of what you are studying, what you want to know about it and what you can measure to help you to find out.

We'll look at each in turn over the next few steps

## The characteristics of what you are studying

Chris Stevenson is a biostatistician in population health, meaning he researches ideas about the policies, treatments or behaviours that could help us become more healthy as a community.  One of the problems he's working on is how to encourage people to make healthier choices of beverages.  

Consuming too much sugar in our drinks is [an international problem](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845). The over consumption of sugary drinks such soft drink or soda, fruit juice and 'energy drinks' is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Singh et. al. 2015).  

Before we can begin to craft effective strategies to combat the problem, it would help to understand its characteristics.  What do the people who drink too much sugar-water have in common?  What reasons can we observe, or they suggest, for their doing so?  

## The shape of the problem

Figuring out the answers to these questions will require a qualitative and quantitative approach.  For example, when you begin your research, you might assume that people consume too many sugary drinks because it's cheap and convenient.  However, it's always possible that if you talk to people or watch them closely, you might find that it's got just as much to do with social and domestic expectations, or the influence of advertising.

If that's the case, then measuring the price of sugary drinks rather than the patterns of consumption of people as a group when their at home or with their friends may not be a helpful way of solving the problem, or the amount of advertising people are exposed to, might not be as helpful.  


### Your task

Search online for data on the consumptions of sugar sweetened beverages in your locality. If you can't find any, use either these [international figures](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124845), or  figures from [Australia](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.007main+features7102011-12) or the [United Kingdom](www.google.com).

Once you have this data, come up with one or two inter-related research questions that could help you to understand the shape of your problem.
