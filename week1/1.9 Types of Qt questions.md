Quantitative research can be used to describe, explore or explain things or behaviours.

As we've seen, quantatitive research is an exceptionally powerful way of understanding how common certain characteristics are, and could help us to understand if they are related.  

There are at least three types of quantitative questions that we will focus on during this course

* __Exploratory research__ helps us understand a problem that we don't know much about yet.  
* __Descriptive research__ helps us to understand the full dimensions of things.  A census is an example of descriptive research, which is used to describe certain characteristics of a group of people. 
* __Explanatory research__ looks not only at what is happening, but why.  

Let's look at an example to illustrate this.

All across the world, the number of people who are going to university is growing.  However, there are still a number of inequalities in acess to higher education.

An __exploratory__ study might try to build an understanding some of the reasons why this might be the case.  It would help us understand the things (sometimes referred to as 'factors' or 'variables') we could measure to keep an eye on the problem.  

A survey is the classic example.  You might design a survey for students starting university for the first time.  It might ask questions about their family's educational and cultural backgrounds, where they live and where they went to school.

You may then consider a __descriptive__ study as a result of the survey.  You might then consider surveying people chosen to represent people with different family backgrounds.  You might be able to describe the number of people who do or don't go on to university, and find out more about their parent's average incomes and levels of education.  

You might find out that fewer people go to university if their family members haven't.  You might even find that [this is a useful measure](https://theconversation.com/why-first-in-family-uni-students-should-receive-more-support-38601), because it can 'stand in' for other factors such as coming from a low income background, or being the child of a migrant.

An __explanatory study__ may then be needed to explain why this is the case.  Is there a clear relationship between people whose family members have never been to university, and staying out of university yourself?  Is there a relationship between being the first in your family to go to university, and dropping out before your degree?

## Your task

There are a number of people, all across the world, who work full time but still struggle to support their family with basic essentials.  Even in a wealthy nation like Australia, there are [reports of families who skip meals to save money](http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2012/s3611587.htm).

Describe an exploratory, descriptive or explanatory study that may help you understand this problem better and leave it in the comments section. 

For those of you who like an extra challenge, find someone else's study and design a study that links up to it.
