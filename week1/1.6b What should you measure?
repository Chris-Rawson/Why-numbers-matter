Choosing the right variables means answering the right question.


## Variables

Quantitative research measures things that vary.  This is essential to understanding how widespread a characteristic is, figuring out what is normal and discovering relationships between things, and determine cause and effect.  It is therefore essential that the variables that you measure have been chosen with care.

Variables are usually described as being either __dependent__ or __independent.__  These labels describe the variables relationship to each other.  A dependent variable will vary _because_ the independent variable does. 

When Miranda and the GLOBE team chose their variables , they took into account the fact that there's already plenty of evidence that drinking too much soda is bad for you. What they were interested in was effective strategies to get people to replace it with healthy drinks instead.  

To find out, they took (1) the price of unhealthy drinks as their independent variable, and (2) the number of drinks unhealthy and (3) healthy drinks sold as their dependent variables. 

## Precision

That leads us to the question, 'how do you decide what's a healthy or unhealthy drink?'   Another way of asking this question might be 'how precise do you need to be?'

Sometimes there's no clear answer. It comes down to how much information you need to satisfy yourself and decision makers that you have can stand by your hypothesis.

Broad categories may be enough, although sometimes we need to take into account complex variables like the proportion of sugar or amount of calories or kilojules in each drink. In practice, it is often wise to take detailed measurements and then categorise them in the analysis phase or when you are explaining their results to people because it's usually easier to group measurements together than it is to re-measure everything.  

For their study, Miranda Blake and the GLOBE team used the [the traffic light system](http://heas.health.vic.gov.au/healthy-choices/guidelines/traffic-light-system), which  ranks food and drink based on their nutritional content.

Water and low-fat milk got a green light.  Small fruit juice, flavoured milk and diet soda got an amber light.  Fizzy, sports and 'energy' drinks got a red.  Even using this system, there were plenty of borderline cases which required 'executive' decisions.  

The convenience store owners agreed to put the price of red drinks up by 20% for an eighteen week trial, and left green and amber unchanged.

## Pragmatism

You might be wondering 'why the traffic light system?'  

The answer to this question is essentially a pragmatic one. The cut off point for what was unhealthy needed to make sense for a convenience store.  The traffic light system has been developed by experts to help food and drink retailers in hospitals to make decisions about which products to offer and promote to customers. 

Moreover, they are guidelines developed by the Victorian State Government, who have primary responsibility for funding and regulating the hospital in which the trial took place. So there is no doubt that the system was applicable to the store itself.

## Access to the data

There's no point defining something for measurement if you can't actually get a sample of the measurements you need. This can be a question about relationships just as much as it can be about equipment.  

In real world research you're often playing on someone elses turf, so you need to play by their rules. Miranda and the team already knew the hospital well, because they had worked together on research projects in the past.  However, working with the owners of the convenience store was a leap of faith for everyone involved.  Staff were generous and professional, so working with the researchers to put up the price of unhealthy drinks and providing them with subsequent sales data was never an issue.  However, at any point, management could have decided to walk away from the trial or refuse access to the data.


## Your task

Miranda and the team decided to use the traffic light system to decide what to categorise as healthy or unhealthy.  What other variables might they have measured, and what other systems might they have used to categorise their measurements.  How do you think this would have affected their analysis?
