There are a number of common statistical analyses that can help you to build an understanding of your research problem.

There are many situations when you're data, or what you're trying to find out, doesn't fit neatly with the types of correlation analysis you've looked at throughout the course.

We've made the following assumptions throughout the course:

* the data we've collected fits the pattern of normal distribution, making parametric analyses a good option
* we want to determine the correlation between only two variables 
* the correlation between the two variables goes in one direction if placed on a scatterplot.

These assumptions have made parametric (normally distributed), linear bivariate correlation analysis an ideal choice for our statistical analysis.  But if any of these assumptions changed, we would be better of using a different statistical test for our analysis.  This is a good reminder of what Nick told us about how important it is to record our assumptions, all the way back in _Why Research Matters_.

Here are some of the most common statistical tests that you could employ, and an idea of when to use them.

## _t_ and ANOVA tests

The _t_ and ANOVA tests show us whether the mean of a population significantly differs from another.  

The keyword here is significant.  In any sample, there's the potential for results to vary quite a bit.  We need to know how much variation from the mean is normal, and what should make us pay more careful attention.

For example, you might want to know how your school performed in standardised testing. If you wanted to know:

* how you performed against a hypothetical target, this requires a [one sample _t_ test] (http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen).
* how you did compared to another school, you'll need a [two sample _t_ test](link)
* how you did compared to two or more schools, you'll need to use [an ANOVA test](link)

## MANOVA tests

The [MANOVA test](link) is basically an ANOVA test, but it can include more than two variables. You could use a MANOVA test to see if telling an athlete that they will have to sit through a boring 45 minute presentation if they're not strongly enough against doping in sport causes them to [pretend an even stronger stance against it on surveys and questionarres](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118507) (not too surprisingly, it does).




## Your task

Imagine you're working on some market research for a newly launched online clothing retailer.  They'd like you to identify different target audiences for different forms and styles of advertising.

You have results from three surveys, each with no less than 300 and no more than 500 respondants.  The surveys ask about people's age and income (using continuous data), their location and the language they speak at home. The surveyors then show people different clothing ads in different forms and styles, and asks them to rank how much they enjoy each ad on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 meaning strong enjoyment.

* Pick one of the tests described in this step
* Find out a little bit more about it
* Let people know what you've discovered, including examples of how you could use it to help you analyse the survey results described.

## For those of you who enjoy a challenge:

Go to [the survey results](link), and perform the test.
