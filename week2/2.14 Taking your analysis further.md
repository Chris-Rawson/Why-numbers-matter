There are a number of common statistical analyses that can help you to build an understanding of your research problem.

There are many situations when you're data, or what you're trying to find out, doesn't fit neatly with the types of correlation analysis you've looked at throughout the course.

We've made the following assumptions throughout the course:

* the data we've collected fits the pattern of normal distribution, making parametric analyses a good option
* we want to determine the correlation between only two variables 
* the correlation between the two variables goes in one direction if placed on a scatterplot.

These assumptions have made parametric, linear bivariate correlation analysis an ideal choice for our statistical analysis.  But if any of these assumptions changed, so would the best choice for our analysis.  This is a good reminder that Nick told us how important it is to record our assumptions, all the way back in _Why Research Matters_.

Here are some of the most common statistical tests that you could employ, and an idea of when to use them.

## the _t_ tests

The _t_ tests show us whether the mean of a population significantly differs from a hypothetical mean [(one sample _t_ test)](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen), or from the mean of another population (two sample).  

The keyword here is significant.  In any two samples, there's the potential for results to vary quite a bit.  We need to know how much variation from the mean is normal, and what should make us pay more careful attention.

For example, you might use a one sample _t_ test to find out if people's blood pressure is significantly higher in your local population than a target range.  A two sample _t_ test might determine the significance of the difference between two school's test results.

It's worth mentioning in passing that something can be statistically significant but still make no practical difference, and vice-versa.

## Your task

Apply what you've learned to an ill-defined scenario (scenario: adding in another variable, or testing more than one test.
