There are a number of common statistical analyses that can help you to build an understanding of your research problem.

There are many situations when you're data, or what you're trying to find out, doesn't fit neatly with the types of correlation analysis you've looked at throughout the course.

We've made the following assumptions throughout the course:

* the data we've collected fits the pattern of normal distribution, making parametric analyses a good option
* we want to determine the correlation between only two variables 
* the correlation between the two variables goes in one direction if placed on a scatterplot.

These assumptions have made parametric (normally distributed), linear bivariate correlation analysis an ideal choice for our statistical analysis.  But if any of these assumptions changed, so would the best choice for our analysis.  This is a good reminder of what Nick told us about how important it is to record our assumptions, all the way back in _Why Research Matters_.

Here are some of the most common statistical tests that you could employ, and an idea of when to use them.

## _t_ and ANOVA tests

The _t_ and ANOVA tests show us whether the mean of a population significantly differs from another.  

The keyword here is significant.  In any sample, there's the potential for results to vary quite a bit.  We need to know how much variation from the mean is normal, and what should make us pay more careful attention.

For example, you might want to know how your school performed in standardised testing. If you wanted to know:

* how you performed against a hypothetical target, this requires a [one sample _t_ test] (http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen).
* how you did compared to another school, you need a [two sample _t_ test](link)
* how you did compared to two or more schools, you'll need to use [an ANOVA test](link)

## Your task

Apply what you've learned to an ill-defined scenario (scenario: adding in another variable, or testing more than one test.
