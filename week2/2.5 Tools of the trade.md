Computer software has made statistical analysis cheap and accessible to the average user.

For most of the rest of the course, we will be practising making statistical calculations.

While it's possible to do all of using a free online calculator, or even pen and paper, we'll be demonstrating using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/) throughout the course.  

Most researchers use software to process their data.  You can often get a free copy of proprietary software through a research institution such as a university if you are a student or staff member.  

Here is some of the most useful software packages for doing research using statistics.

## Google Sheets 

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/) is free online software similar to Microsoft Excel or the freely downloadable [OpenOffice Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html), although with limited functions.  It allows you to create spreadsheets of data, perform statistical tests and produce graphs.  Useful for simple and advanced purposes, the more you get to know the product the more powerful you realise that it is.

It _can_ be used on a mobile device, but we wouldn't recommend it on a phone.

Unfortunately, using it for more advanced purposes takes a steep learning curve.

It would be fine to use MS Excel of OpenOffice Calc rather than Google Sheets, if you'd prefer. They're almost identical.

## SPSS

[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/au-en/marketplace/spss-statistics) is a very common tool for doing statistical research.  It's popular with researchers who need to do statistics, but are not themselves statisticians.

It performs a number of otherwise quite complex statistical tests on your data with the click of a button.  It takes a little bit of getting used to, but once you get going it's a fairly easy program to get to know.

SPSS is expensive.  Those who do not have institutional access may wish to consider [PSPP](https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/) ([download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pspp4windows/)), which is basically a free clone of SPSS.  The only problem is that it's difficult (but not impossible) to install on a Mac.

If you have access to SPSS or PSPP, you might like to use it rather than Google Sheets to follow along with the course.

## R

[R](https://www.r-project.org) ([download](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)) - is freely downloadable statistical software.  Preferred by many statisticians, R is a no frills statistical monster that is your to command.  It that allows you precise control over the tests run on your data.

Recommended only for advanced users who are familiar with both statistics and computer programming, it can be a very steep learning curve indeed.

## Comparison

Software | Free? | Web based? | Mac compatible?
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/) | Yes | Yes | Yes

[MS Excel](https://products.office.com/en-au/excel) | No | Yes (but not very good) |Yes

[OpenOffice Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) |Yes | No| Yes

[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/au-en/marketplace/spss-statistics) |  No  | No | Yes

[PSPP](https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/) | Yes | No | With difficulty

[R](https://www.r-project.org) | Yes | No  | Yes


## Your task

Create a fresh new sheet using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com.au/sheets/about/) by following the instructions in the video.

If you're using different software, create a new workspace.

Then, tell us what you like or don't like about the statistical software you've chosen to use in the comments section.
