Computer software has made statistical analysis cheap and accessible to the average user.

For much of the rest of the course, we will be practising making statistical calculations. 

While it's possible to do this all using a [free online calculator](http://www.calculator.net)(it's even rumoured that in people used pen and paper in a bygone era), it will be useful for you to download some software.  

The most commonly used tool to calculate statistics for research purposes is [SPSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPSS).  

## PSPP

SPSS is not free, so unless you have access to it elsewhere, we recommend that you use [PSPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPP).  PSPP was developed as a free alternative to SPSS, and is almost identical. It should run on modern PCs and Macs.

For the rest of the course, any descriptions we use describing software will be in reference to PSPP. We'll make sure to include screenshots for those of you using a mobile to participate in the course.

Your task:

Download PSPP, take a screenshot of it working, and add your screenshot onto the [Trello board](link).
