## Correlations help us to understand if, and how, the things we have measured are related.

Is immigration related with an increase in unemployment?  Do trade barriers, such as tariffs, diminish economic growth?  

Some of the most persistent discussions we have, and largest decisions we make, as a society are about how two or more things might be connected.  These discussions explicitly relate to questions about correlations.

Other decisions we make are also about correlations, albeit more implicitly.  For example, which areas of a city require the most police, which methods of teaching schoolchildren are most effective, what strategies could we use to engage more people in the Arts or where should we build new infrastructure to ensure that our political party are returned to office?

As researchers, we have the power to help inform the discussion and make better decisions by providing detailed and accurate answers to many of these questions.  


## What is a correlation, anyway?

In everyday speech, things that are 'co-related' are simply things that share some kind of connection.  According to some cleaners we've spoken to, a warm day is correlated with sand in the carpets of some researchers offices at both Griffith and Deakin Universities.

In statistics, a correlation is an interrelationship between two variables.  Finding out if, and how, they are related can help us to solve problems.

Take an example that comes close to the heart







Example b:


in many developed nations, kids aren't walking or riding their bikes to school anymore.  We know that walking or riding to school is more environmentally friendly.  We also know that it is correlated with children's mental and social development, their physical health, their independence and that it is also a safer way to travel than driving (Kingham & Ussher 2007).

So what could a researcher do about it?  One thing would be to find out the who is riding to school and what they have in common.  Once we know that, we can isolate different variables to see if they are correlated to 


Or to put
