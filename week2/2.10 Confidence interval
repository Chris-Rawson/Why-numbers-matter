## Confidence intervals gives us an indication of how much the mean differs from that of the target population's.

Some of you may have already commented in the last step that we're potentially excluding people who really _did_ do more than 122 push-ups, or less than 25.

After all, we don't know much about this sample.  What if the gym-goers who did less than 25 were elderly, or those who did more than 122 were just exceptionally fit?  Ok, 181 push-ups in two minutes stretches credulity, but is 140 really so implausible?

The only way we have of becoming more certain of the range of push-ups that gym users could do in under two minutes is to keep taking tests, and to compare the results.  However, there is a way of determining how confident we are about the results of our sample.

We saw [in the previous step](link) that there's no more than a one in twenty chance of a measurement falling more than two standard deviations from the mean.  

The same thing applies to the mean of your measurements.  There's a 95% chance that the real population average will be within two standard deviations of your mean.  That's handy to know, right?


## confidence intervals

But what if you have more than one sample, and therefore more than one mean?

That's a good problem to have - because it gives us more information we can use to make a precise measurement.  But it does require some more mathematics.

Let's say we want to be a bit more confident about our results, so we went back to the gym and took another sample. It stands to reason that there ought to be a 95% chance that the new mean _also_ lies within two standard deviations of the target population.  

But just because we went to the same gym twice, it doesn't mean we've measured the same type of people.  What if the first time we went a professional sports team were training?

We can check whether or not our samples come from the same population by asking if they lie within a certain range of each other.

If you're interested, the mathematics are reasonably straight forward.  

There's a good guide to
