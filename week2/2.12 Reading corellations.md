# Reading corellations can be baffling for the uninitiated, but once you have your head around them they are very handly little calculations.

A bi-variate, or Pearson's, correlation is a formula that maps out how closely two variables move together.   

There's often written with an r value, and a p value in brackets.  For example, r=0.684 (p=>001).

But what on earth does that mean?

## Strenth of the correlation

The r value represents the 'correlation coefficient.'

The correlation coefficient is an indication of the strenth of the relationship between two variables, and is expressed as a range between -1 and 1.

By the way, these correlations are usually only employed for parametric data, or data that fits with normal distribution.  But that's not always the case, and even so, you would read it the same way.



While correlation coefficients are normally reported as r = (a value between -1 and +1), squaring them makes then easier to understand. The square of the coefficient (or r square) is equal to the percent of the variation in one variable that is related to the variation in the other. After squaring r, ignore the decimal point. An r of .5 means 25% of the variation is related (.5 squared =.25). An r value of .7 means 49% of the variance is related (.7 squared = .49).
