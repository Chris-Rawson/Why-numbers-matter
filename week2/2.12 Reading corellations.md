# Reading corellations can be baffling for the uninitiated, but once you have your head around them they are very handly little calculations. [revise: correlation is just between time and grades, not time spent playing games and grades -add in link to determining r and p in Google Sheets]

A bi-variate correlation is a formula that describes how closely two variables move together.   

There's often written with an r value, and a p value in brackets.  For example, our researcher who are looking at [the relationship between using software to learn fractions and grade sixers test scores](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=numeracy), might express the correlation as r=0.484 (p=>001).

In this step, we'll take a look at what that means.


### Correlation coefficient

The r value represents the 'correlation coefficient.'  It's an indication of the strenth of the relationship between two variables.

To test the hypothesis _that the greater the amount of the time sixth-graders use educational software to learn fractions, the higher their test scores will be graded_, we'd need to look at two variables: time and test scores.  If the test scores improve as the students spend longer using the software then there's a positive correlation between them.  If there tests scores actually go _further down_ the longer they play the game, then we can be confident in a negative correlation.   

The __r value__, or correlation coefficient, tells you the probability that two things correlate. It's always expressed as being between -1 and 1. 

* 1 means that if one thing happens, another thing will always happen uniformly and predictably.  If we had a one in our scenario, it would mean that we could accurate predict improvements in student's test score just by recording how long they'd spent using the software.
* 0 means there's no relationship, or that the relationship is completely random.  If we had a zero, it would mean using the software doesn't seem to have any effect on student's test scores whatsoever.
* -1 is a mirror image of 1.  Just like with 1, if we had a score of -1 we could use this to accurately predict student's test scores based on how long they'd spent using the software.  The difference is that instead of improving, the test scores would steadily decrease

[insert stuff about confounds - your task to discuss decisions based on this : would you want further information, what are potential confounds, etc].

Squaring your r value might make it easier to understand.  An r of .5 means 25% of the variation is related (.5 squared =.25). An r value of .7 means 49% of the variance is related (.7 squared = .49).

### Descriptions of the correlation coefficient.

You might sometimes come across a description of a correlation coefficient that's described in words rather than numbers.  There are conventions for these too, so it's worth knowing how the words relate to the numbers:

| __R value__ | __Description__ |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.5 - 1 | Strong positive correlation |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Moderate positive correlation |
| 0.1 - 0.3 | Weak positive correlation |

We'd see a mirror of these descriptions for negative correlations.

## Confidence

So that deals with the r value, but what does the 'p' mean?

You may not realise it, but you've encountered this before during [Step 2.9: Confidence Intervals](link).

The p value is an expression of how confident we are that the correlation isn't just a coincidence.  If that probability is lower than 5% (P=<0.05), then it falls within the conventional limits set out by a 95% confidence interval.  Once it gets to p=<0.001 most people stop there; so, if p=0.000464, it will usually be written as p=<0.001.  After all, how much more certain do you really need to be?  

## How convincing are the results?

Obviously, the further that _r_ is from 0 and the lower the _p_ value, the more confident you can be that your variables are correlated.

How strong these results need to be the strength of the evidence you'd expect to find to support your hypothesis. 

In the case of the schoolchildren learning to solve problems with fractions, we have to remember that predicting human behaviour is a complex task.  Using software isn't the only thing you'd need to account for.  If your correlation co-efficient is too weak then researchers might rightly conclude that the strategy is not particularly effective; too strong, that the research [may not have been undertaken correctly](link to step on validity).

Because of the complex nature of the factors involved in learning, the researchers included a control group - students who _didn't_ spend any time using the software.  This made it much clearer how much of the improvement can reasonably be attributed to the software itself. 

[__Potential inclusion #1__ In this situation, if we found any kind of strong positive correlation coefficient (r=>0.5), we'd probably be quite pleased with the results.  Add in a control group which shows a significantly weaker correlation and you would think that there's a case for pushing for the software's adoption in schools.]


## Your task

Researchers were aware that educational software was available to help schoolchildren learn to problem solve with fractions, but that they were not widely adopted.

They hypothesised _that the greater the amount of the time sixth-graders use educational software to learn fractions, the higher their test scores will be graded._

To test their hypothesis, they split students into two groups.  One group was given lessons in fractions from their teacher and also used educational software.  The control group just had lessons from their teacher.  Both groups were tested on their fractions using a standardised test before and after their lessons.

The correlation between time between tests and their test results was __r=0.684 (p=>001)__.  The correlation in the control group was __r=0.030 (p=>001).

Describe what this means in your own words.  Is this result strong enough to justify an investment in the software and teacher training in schools?
