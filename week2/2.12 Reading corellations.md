# Reading corellations can be baffling for the uninitiated, but once you have your head around them they are very handly little calculations. [remove material re: line of best fit]

A bi-variate correlation is a formula that describes how closely two variables move together.   

There's often written with an r value, and a p value in brackets.  For example, our researcher who are looking at [the relationship between using software to learn fractions and grade sixers test scores](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=numeracy), might express the correlation as r=0.684 (p=>001).

In this step, we'll take a look at what that means.


### Correlation coefficient

The r value represents the 'correlation coefficient.'  It's an indication of the strenth of the relationship between two variables.

To test the hypothesis _that the greater the amount of the time sixth-graders use educational software to learn fractions, the higher their test scores will be graded_, we'd need to look at two variables: time and test scores.  If the test scores improve as the students spend longer using the software then there's a positive correlation between them.  If there tests scores actually go _further down_ the longer they play the game, then we can be confident in a negative correlation.   

The __r value__, or correlation coefficient, tells you the probability that two things correlate. It's always expressed as being between -1 and 1. 

* 1 means that if one thing happens, another thing will always happen uniformly and predictably.  If we had a one in our scenario, it would mean that we could accurate predict improvements in student's test score just by recording how long they'd spent using the software.
* 0 means there's no relationship, or that the relationship is completely random.  If we had a zero, it would mean using the software doesn't seem to have any effect on student's test scores whatsoever.
* -1 is a mirror image of 1.  Just like with 1, if we had a score of -1 we could use this to accurately predict student's test scores based on how long they'd spent using the software.  The difference is that instead of improving, the test scores would steadily decrease

[insert stuff about confounds - your task to discuss decisions based on this : would you want further information, what are potential confounds, etc].

Squaring your r value might make it easier to understand.  An r of .5 means 25% of the variation is related (.5 squared =.25). An r value of .7 means 49% of the variance is related (.7 squared = .49).

### Descriptions of the correlation coefficient.

You might sometimes come across a description of a correlation coefficient that's described in words rather than numbers.  There are conventions for these too, so it's worth knowing how the words relate to the numbers:

| __R value__ | __Description__ |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.5 - 1 | Strong positive correlation |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Moderate positive correlation |
| 0.1 - 0.3 | Weak positive correlation |

We'd see a mirror of these descriptions for negative correlations.

How 'good' a result is really depends on the context of your research project and the strength of the evidence you'd expect to find to support your hypothesis.  In the case of the schoolchildren learning to solve problems with fractions, we'd expect a number of factors to also play a role, including the student's teacher, parental support, self-confidence with mathematics and social or cultural.  In this situation, if we found any kind of strong positive correlation (above 0.5), we'd probably be quite pleased with the results.  Add in a control group which shows a significantly weaker correlation and you would think that there's a case for pushing for the software's adoption in schools.

By the way, these correlations are usually employed for parametric data, or data that fits with normal distribution.  

## Confidence

So that deals with the r value, but what does the 'p' mean?

You may not realise it, but you've encountered this before during [Step 2.9: Confidence Intervals](link).

The p value is an expression of how confident we are that the correlation isn't just a coincidence.  If that probability is lower than 5% (P=<0.05), then it falls within the conventional limits set out by a 95% confidence interval.  Once it gets lower than <0.001 most people stop there, because how much more certain do you really need to be?  

## What about non-linear correlation?
