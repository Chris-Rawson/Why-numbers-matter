Welcome to Week 2 

The week we're going to take a look at how we can use statistics to make decisions.

Statistics help you to get a good understand of the big picture of your research problem by taking a look at a portion of it up close.

Statistics involves a process of collecting, organising and analysing numerical data from a small section  which can be used to stand in for a bigger picture.  With good study design, we can then devise statistical tests that can tell us if something causes something else and the strength of the relationship between them.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the week, you'll be able to: 

* apply statistical analysis to make decisions about real world problems.
* interpret bivariate correlations
* design a quantitative study to answer a research question


## Your task

Tell us what you're interested in learning about this week, and how it might help with your research problem.
