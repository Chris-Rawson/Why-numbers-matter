# Welcome to Week 2 [video]

The week we're going to take a look at how we can use statistics to make decisions.

Statistics help you to get a good understand of the big picture of your research problem by taking a look at a portion of it up close.

Statistics involves a process of collecting, organising and analysing numerical data from a small section (or [sample](glossary)) which can be used to stand in for a bigger picture (or [population](glossary)).  


## Learning outcomes

By the end of the week, you'll be able to: {REVIEW - add proportions}

* apply statistical analysis to make decisions about real world problems.
* interpret bivariate correlations
* design a quantitative study to answer a research question


## How statistics can solve problems

We can use statistics to help solve problems, because they let us understand what your problem is like, identify the factors that could improve it and measure the effects of any changes you've implemented.

Throughout Week 2, you'll explore some of the most common statistical techniques and tests researchers use to solve problems, including understanding how your sample is distributed, using software to generate a correlation analysis and how to interpret it. 

Let's take an example.  

Reducing the number of cars on the road would reduce traffic congestion and emit less carbon into the atmosphere. This would mitigate some of the impacts of climate change, improve people's health and make businesses that rely on the roads for transport more efficient. 

However in some areas, few people share a car with a colleague or neighbour when travelling to work.  



If you're doing some research 

How would a research know  how many cars are owned by residents of a household on average, the number of children living there that are old enough to drive, and whether there is a relationship between the two?

In other words, how do you know the proportions of important characteristics of your population (such as car ownership, children old enough to have a licence), and figure out if they are correlated?

To answer these questions, you need to calculate **proportions** and **corellations.**

Proportion
Proportion helps us to understand how regularly something happens within different sections of the population.  
For example, you might find out that

*	10% of households have no cars
*	25% have one car
* 45% have two
* 20% have more than two

Or that, on average, households have 2.6 cars each, or 2.2 cars each if you exclude share-houses and 1.9 if you if you also exclude extended families.

You might then dig a little deeper and find out that houses with 3 children old enough to have a driver’s licence have three and a half cars, on average.

It might also be useful to find out how likely these results are to deviate from the average (called **standard deviation**), and determine how likely the results from our sample are to be representative of the whole (called **confidence intervals**).

## Correlation

Correlation helps us to figure out if there might be a relationship between what’s happening.  The question ‘do people with more kids old enough to drive own more cars’ could be expressed as the hypothesis:

> That the more children of driving age reside in a household, the more cars that the residents of the households will own.

If we find that the average number of cars that are owned by residents of a household goes up with the number of driving aged children living there, then we might be able to say these two things are correlated.  

The clearer the pattern that these two things go up or down together, the more confident we are in that correlation.

## Your task

Tell us what you're interested in learning about this week, and how it might help with your research problem.

Share your thoughts in the comments section.

For those of you who like a challenge:

Imagine that you now need to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of cars owned by residents of a household, and the number of children old enough to hold a licence living in those households.

How would you design a study that asks this question?
