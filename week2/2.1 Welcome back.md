# Welcome to Week 2 [video]

The week we're going to take a look at how statistics can help to inform our thinking and decision making.

## Statistics

Statistics help us understand the whole picture by taking a look at a portion of it up close.  

Statistics involves a process of collecting, organising and analysing numerical data from a small section (or ‘sample’) which can be used to stand in for (or ‘represent’) a bigger picture (or ‘population’).  

If we want to be confident that our results really do represent the bigger picture, we need to be careful about how we characterise, collect and analyse data.  We looked at this last week when we asked ‘what do you measure?’
Correlation and proportion

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the week, you'll be able to:

* apply statistical analysis to make decisions about real world problems / determine proportions.
* calculate bivariate correlations using computer software, and
* justify the role of quantitative research in your research project

## Proportion and correlation


How would a research know  how many cars are owned by residents of a household on average, the number of children living there that are old enough to drive, and whether there is a relationship between the two?

In other words, how do you know the proportions of important characteristics of your population (such as car ownership, children old enough to have a licence), and figure out if they are correlated?

To answer these questions, you need to calculate **proportions** and **corellations.**

Proportion
Proportion helps us to understand how regularly something happens within different sections of the population.  
For example, you might find out that

*	10% of households have no cars
*	25% have one car
* 45% have two
* 20% have two or more

Or that, on average, households have 2.6 cars each, or 2.2 cars each if you exclude share-houses and 1.9 if you if you also exclude extended families.

You might then dig a little deeper and find out that houses with 3 children old enough to have a driver’s licence have three and a half cars, on average.

It might also be useful to find out how likely these results are to deviate from the average (called **standard deviation**), and determine how likely the results from our sample are to be representative of the whole (called **confidence intervals**).

## Correlation

Correlation helps us to figure out if there might be a relationship between what’s happening.  The question ‘do people with more kids old enough to drive own more cars’ could be expressed as the hypothesis:

> That the more children of driving age reside in a household, the more cars that the residents of the households will own.

If we find that the average number of cars that are owned by residents of a household goes up with the number of driving aged children living there, then we might be able to say these two things are correlated.  

The clearer the pattern that these two things go up or down together, the more confident we are in that correlation.

## Your task
