# Welcome to Week 2 [video]

The week we're going to take a look at how statistics can help to inform our thinking and decision making.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the week, you'll be able to:

* apply statistical analysis to make decisions about real world problems.
* calculate bivariate correlations using computer software, and
* justify the role of quantitative research in your research project

## What we'll cover

We'll take a closer look into taking a sample, finding out about the sample's average characteristics and figuring out how likely it is that your sample average will be similar to the whole population's average.

We'll also look at how to figure out if something causes something is, is related to it or if what we're observing is simply a co-incidence. We'll use computer software to figure out how two things may be inter-related. 

Moreover, description of correlations are exceptionally common in research articles, so we'll look at how to read them to figure out what they really mean for us.

Finally, we'll help you to put together a study design for your portfolio that applies what you've learnt through the course.

## Your task

Let us know what you're looking forward to this week.
