How do you ensure you have an valid sample of who, or what, you are testing?

There is never a perfect answer to this question, so you need to think through the implications carefully.

To do so, you should go through a process which will help you to identify your **target population**, your __sample__ and your __sample frame__.  It's at this stage that you might also want to consider introducing a __control group__.

To help illustrate these concepts, we'll look at the hypothesis:

> that having higher than normal blood pressure increases your risk of developing a heart disease.

It was this and other questions about cardiovascular health that the researchers who first set up the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/index.php) had in mind.

## Target population

Your target population is the whole thing that you want to take a sample from.  In this case, this is very broad.  As we'll need people with various levels of blood pressure to participate our target population is every human being.  

It's not currently possible to measure every living person's blood pressure, so we'll need to look for a sample.

Despite the [origin of the term](https://www.etymonline.com/word/population), in statistic 'population' doesn't always refer to people or living things.  If you trying to figure out the proportion of houses fitted with fire-retardent cladding in an area prone to fires, your target population consists of houses.  

## Sample population
A study that looks at every single occurance of something happening, rather than taking a sample, is a census.  

For most statistical studies, you need to take a sample. Your sample population is essentially everyone or everything that's available within the boundaries of what you are attempting to sample.  

In the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/index.php), researchers decided it would be a good idea to get a very comprehensive picture of the cardiovascular health of the inhabitants of the town of [Framingham, Massachusetts, USA](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Framingham,+MA,+USA/@42.3049056,-71.506952,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e38838715d77df:0x9ea068cb22156362!8m2!3d42.279286!4d-71.4161565).  The town's residents are, then, the study's sample population.

## Sample

have been taking measurements of the cardiovascular health of the same 5,200 people in the town of Framingham in the United States every two years since 1948.  They're now also taking measurements from their children and grandchildren.

## Your task
Students define a representative population sample from data based on a case study.
