How do you ensure you have an valid sample of who, or what, you are testing?

There is never a perfect answer to this question, so you need to think through the implications carefully.

To do so, you should go through a process which will help you to identify your **target population**, your __sample__ and your __sample frame__.  It's at this stage that you might also want to consider introducing a __control group__.

To help illustrate these concepts, we'll look at the hypothesis:

## Target population

[answers are never easy and never perfect, so you’ve got to think about it]
- Sample (who you’ve got)
- Sample frame (who you’ve measured)
- Target population - which may be representative.  
If you’re taking a sample of PS children,
the frame needs to be children who go to a school (leaving out homeschool)


Sample, something selected from school children


## Your task
Students define a representative population sample from data based on a case study.
