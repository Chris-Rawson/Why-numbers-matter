How do you ensure you have an valid sample of who, or what, you are testing?

There is never a perfect answer to this question, so you need to think through the implications carefully.

To do so, you should go through a process which will help you to identify your **target population**, your __sample__ and your __sample frame__.  It's at this stage that you might also want to consider introducing a __control group__.

To help illustrate these concepts, we'll look at the hypothesis:

> that having higher than normal blood pressure increases your risk of developing a heart disease.

It was this and other questions about cardiovascular health that the researchers who first set up the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/index.php) had in mind.

## Target population

Your target population is the whole thing that you want to take a sample from.  In this case, this is very broad.  As we'll need people with various levels of blood pressure to participate our target population is every human being.  

It's not currently possible to measure every living person's blood pressure, so we'll need to look for a sample.

Despite the [origin of the term](https://www.etymonline.com/word/population), in statistic 'population' doesn't always refer to people or living things.  If you trying to figure out the proportion of houses fitted with fire-retardent cladding in an area prone to fires, your target population consists of houses.  

## Sample population
A study that looks at every single occurance of something happening, rather than taking a sample, is a census.  

For most statistical studies, you need to take a sample. Your sample population is essentially everyone or everything that's available within the boundaries of what you are attempting to sample.  

In the [Framingham Heart Study](https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/index.php), researchers decided it would be a good idea to get a very comprehensive picture of the cardiovascular health of the inhabitants of the town of [Framingham, Massachusetts, USA](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Framingham,+MA,+USA/@42.3049056,-71.506952,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e38838715d77df:0x9ea068cb22156362!8m2!3d42.279286!4d-71.4161565).  The town's residents are, then, the study's sample population.

## Sample

Now to the hard part: your sample.  You will get to know your sample well, so choose them with care.  

You sample is simply the people or things that you have decided to measure.  Sometimes it's not feasible to measure everyone or everything in your sample population, or sometimes it would simply make things more complicated than they need to be.  

The researchers in the Framingham Heart Study have been taking measurements of the cardiovascular health of the same 5,200 people in the town of Framingham in the United States every two years since 1948.  They're now also taking measurements from their children and grandchildren.  This is an exceptionally rich longtitudinal sample.  

So how do _you_ pick who or what you want to be as part of your sample?  There are [a number of strategies](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat100/node/18) you might consider:

* **Convenience sampling.** Just choosing whoor whatever is nearest to you.  You should only do this if you have no other way of sampling at your disposal, because your results will usually not reflect your target population meaning they will be biased.
* **Random sampling.**  Ensure that everyone or everything in your sample has the same probability of being selected.  
* **Stratified sampling** is when you first group your sample population into sections with similar characteristics, and then sample randomly within it.  It's common, for example, to sample the same number of people aged 15 to 24 as you do aged 25 to 34 and so on.

If you are using a control group, care must be taken to select participants for both groups using the same method.

## Sampling bias
Your sample is biased if your data is collected in such a way that it is unlikely to be representative of the target population.  If your target population is human beings and gender is likely to be a factor in your study, you might not want to recruit participants from somewhere where more ment than women congregate, or vice-versa.


## Your task
1) Think back to the research question from the previous step.  Define a target sample and a sample population, and tell us how you will sample from them.  Share in the comments section. 

OR

2) The Framingham Heart Study has taken cardiovascular health measurements from people in the town over a period of nearly 70 years.  How would you define a sample population in your local area, and what method would you use to sample them?  Why?
