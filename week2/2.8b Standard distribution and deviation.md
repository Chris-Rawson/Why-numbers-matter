Standard deviation describes how much variation youâ€™re likely to encounter in your sample.

As researchers, we tend to measure things that already have something in common.  If you're observing the length of the leaves on a tree or a person's blood pressure, there's only so much variation you'd expect to find. In most, but not all, cases most of your observations will fall close by to the mean.

Statisticians have seen so many different measurements come and go that they noticed a pattern in the observations themselves.  This pattern is called __standard distribution__.

Experienced quantitative researchers have gotten to know this pattern so well that they have developed a number of formulas that we can use to understand how likely, or unlikely, a result is so long as it conforms to the pattern of standard distribution.


## Normal distribution

Normal (or standard) distribution looks a bit like this. 

In this fictional scenario, a researcher has asked some dedicated gym users to show us how many pushups they could do in a two minute period.  Here were the results:

[insert image]

On the:

* X (horizontal) axis is the number of pushups people did.
* Y (vertical) axis is the number of people who did that many pushups.

Two people made the lowest total of the group, with ten pushups each.  One person was in her own class, making the greatest number of 149 pushups in under two minutes.  

You can see that the greatest proportion of people - around 17.5% - did between 70 and 80 pushups in two minutes, which is impressive.  Just under did between 60 and 90.  That leaves the only 33% of people who did more or less than this,I hit a golfball that it went a different distance, meaning that these were either unusually long or unusually short.

## Standard deviation

Standard deviation lets figure out how likely something is to vary from the average with some precision.  So long as your data fits with normal distribution, we can use the pattern to work out how unusual one of your observations if you know the mean and the standard deviation.

This is because 68% of observations will fall within one standard deviation above or below the mean, 95% within two and 99.7% within three.

All you need to do to figure out the range, is add or subtract the standard deviation from the mean.  

In the example above, our mean was 74.3 and the standard deviation was 24.7. This means that you could reasonably expect that

* 68% of people did between 49.6 and 99 puships
* 95% of people did between 24.9 and 123.7
* 99.7% of people did between 0.2 and 148.4 

That means that the one woman who managed 149 really is in a league of her own.  Statisticians would call her an 'outlier.'

## What if your sample is not normally distributed?

Not _everything_ that you observe will fit the pattern of normal distribution.  If it doesn't, you'd be better off applying other ['non-parametric' tests](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/11/a-guide-to-conduct-analysis-using-non-parametric-tests/).

There are three easy ways to tell if your data does __not__ fit the pattern.

* When you [create a histogram](link) from your data, it looks lopsided, skewed or like a camel with two humps

* If your mean and your median are a long way apart
* If you have a small sample of 20 observations or less

If that happens, and you don't already have a fairly good idea of what to do, we'd strongly recommend that you consider seeking advice from an expert in statistics to ensure that your research results or valid and reliable.
