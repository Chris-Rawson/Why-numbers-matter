Standard deviation describes how much variation youâ€™re likely to encounter in your sample.

Most things follow a normal pattern of distribution when we measure them.  If you measured 50 people's diastolic blood pressure level, chances are that the the majority of them will have a reading close by to the mean and the median. 

If the measurements in your sample are normally distributed, then you will be able to use standard deviation as a guide to figuring out how normal or unusual it is to have a certain cholesterol reading.  This could then be used to tell us if your blood pressure is high, or indicate that your readings may be incorrect.

## Standard distribution

Once you've taken all your measurements, you could arrange them by the number of readings you have within a certain range.

For example, in our sample taken from the Framingham Heart Study, there is a range of readings from 60 through to 127. Yet over 44% of the readings fall between 80 and 90, and 70% between 80 and 100. 

It will probably not surprise you to learn that the mean is 85.3 and the median is 84.  Indeed, if your data is standardly distributed, there will be very little difference between your mean and median.

Most things that we measure are like this.  Whether it's how tall you are, how much you earn or how often you take a shower, there's a pretty good chance that you'll be similar to the people around you.  When we graph that out using a histogram - a type of bar chart - it usually looks something like the famous bellcurve, as displayed below.

## What if your sample is not normally distributed?
Use this online calculator.  If your histogram doesn't fit the curve, you don't have normal distribution.
