Standard deviation describes how much variation youâ€™re likely to encounter in your sample.

As researchers, we tend to measure things that already have something in common.  If you're measuring the length of the leaves on a tree or a person's blood pressure, there's only so much variation you'd expect to find.  It's very common for most of the leaves, or most of the people's blood pressures, to be in the vicinity of the average.  Although, of course, this is not always the case.

Statisticians have seen so many different measurements come and go that they noticed a pattern in the measurements themselves.  This pattern is called __standard distribution__.

Experienced quantitative researchers have gotten to know this pattern so well that they have developed a number of formulas that we can use to understand how likely, or unlikely, a result is so long as it conforms to the pattern of standard distribution.


## Standard distribution

Standard (or normal) distribution looks a bit like this. 

In this fictional scenario, a researcher has asked some dedicated gym users to show us how many pushups they could do in a two minute period.  Here were the results:

[insert image]

On the:

* X (horizontal) axis is the number of pushups people did.
* Y (vertical) axis is the number of people who did that many pushups.

Two people made the lowest total of the group, with ten pushups each.  One person was in her own class, making the greatest number of 149 pushups in under two minutes.  

You can see that the greatest proportion of people - around 17.5% - did between 70 and 80 pushups in two minutes, which is impressive.  Just under did between 60 and 90.  That leaves the only 33% of people who did more or less than this,I hit a golfball that it went a different distance, meaning that these were either unusually long or unusually short. [revise with exact figures]

The actual numbers are less important than the curve of the graph.  If you make a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) from one of the variables in your data, and it looks like the famous bell curve, then your data probably follows the pattern of standard distribution.

You can check this yourself by...[making a histogram in excel, checking against the bellcurve line]. 



## Standard deviation

Standard deviation is a measure that you can use to figure out how likely something is to vary from the average.

Thanks to the dedication of mathematics and statistics researchers, we can use the pattern of standard distribution to figure out how unusual one of your observations is with some precision.  All you need to do is to calculate the standard deviation.

This is because if your data fits the pattern, we know that 

* 68% of your observations will fall within one standard deviation above or below the mean
* 95% of your observations will fall within two standard deviations above or below the mean
* 99.7% of your observations will fall within three.

All you need to do to make this work for you is to [find the mean], [calculate the standard deviation] and then add or subtract the standard deviation from the mean.  


In the example above, the mean number of times that people did a pushup in two minutes was an impressive 74.3.  The standard deviation was 24.7.  This means we know that:

* 68% of people did between 49.6 and 99 pushups (74.3, plus or minus 24.7)
* 95% of people did between 24.9 and 123.7
* 99.7% of people did between 0.2 and 148.4 


Because the pushups observations fit with the pattern of standard distribution, we know that 68% of people did between 49.6 and 99 (74.3, plus or minus 24.7) pushups.  

That means that the one woman who managed 149 really is in a league of her own.  Statisticians would call her an 'outlier.'

## What if your sample is not normally distributed?

Not _everything_ that you observe will fit the pattern of standard distribution.  If it doesn't, you'd be better off applying other ['non-parametric' tests](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/11/a-guide-to-conduct-analysis-using-non-parametric-tests/).

There are three easy ways to tell if your data does __not__ fit the pattern.

* When you [create a histogram](link) from your data, it looks lopsided, skewed or like a camel with two humps
[!images](link)
* If your mean and your median are a long way apart
* If you have a small sample of 20 observations or less

If that happens, and you don't already have a fairly good idea of what to do, we'd strongly recommend that you consider a research collaboration with a statistician or mathematician.
