What type of data will you collect to answer your research question? [review - too many words]

Data come in different forms, each with their own properties and possibilities.  Sometimes the type of data you collect will be clear, but often you will need to make a choice between asking for an exact number or numbers within a range.  The decision you make will [affect what you can do with your data](https://research-collective.com/blog/data-types/), and therefore your results.

In this step, we'll define the major types of data.

![Types of data](https://github.com/Chris-Rawson/Why-numbers-matter/blob/master/typesofdata.jpg) 

Data can be __numerical__ or __categorical__.  Numerical data can be __discrete__ or __continuous__, and categorical data can be __nominal__ , __ordinal__ or __ratio__.


## Numerical data

Numerical data represents measurements, like length or height or the number of cigarettes you smoke in a day.


| Category | Subcategory | Description | Example |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| -----|
| __Discrete__ | N/A | Only takes on certain values | You can have two or three children, not two and a half |
| __Continuous__ | N/A | Takes on any value | Length, blood pressure |
| Continuous | Interval | Zero (and scale) is arbitrary | Temperature, customer satisfaction rating |
| Continuous | Ration| Fixed scale, zero means 'nothing' | Weight, height, cigarettes smoked per day |

## Categorical data

| Category | Description | Example |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|




## Numerical and categorical data

Numerical data represent measurements, such as length or height or the number of cigarettes a person smokes in a week.  You can tell data is numerical if it can be compared as being greater or less other numbers.

Categorical data represent categories, like whether or not someone is married or their level of education.   You might sometimes see it described as _qualitative data_, because it describes the qualities of things rather than their quantities.

## Discrete and continuous data

Numerical data could be [discrete](glossary) or [continuous](glossary).

__Discrete__ data is used for counting discrete and separate things, so it can only take certain values. For example, you can have two or three children, but you can't have two and a half.

__Continuous__ data measures things can take on any value.  For example, your blood pressure.  You might also use [interval](glossary) and [ratio](glossary) data, which are both forms of continuous data. 

Interval data are measured on a scale that are equally distant from one-another numerically, but not necessarily in reality.  For example, degrees of heat or a ranking of your satisfaction from one to five.  This means they can be compared, but you can't multiply or divide them because you can't _really_ be twice as satisfied as someone else.

Ratio data has all the qualities of interval data, except that the distance between the numbers are not arbitrary.  Something can be twice as heavy as something else.

One of the easiest ways to check if you are using interval or ratio data is to look at the zero.  If the zero really means nothing, then you're using ratio data.  If something weighs zero grams, then it doesn't weigh anything.  However, with temperature or customer satisfaction surveys, zero is just another point on the scale.

## Nominal and ordinal data

Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal.

__Nominal__ data represent things that you can count but can't order, like gender or occupation.

__Ordinal__ data can be used to put things into order, like if someone is a non, ocassional, light or heavy smoker.  A common example is survey questions asking you how strongly you feel about a statement, with options ranging from strongly disagree through to strongly agree.

## Continuous or ordinal data?

The main choice that you have to make is between using continuous or ordinal data.

Do you count the number of cigarettes people smoke in a week or categorise them as light or heavy smokers?  Do you ask someone's age, or ask if they're between 45 and 54?

The answer to this question largely depends on 

* the data you have access to
* how deeply you'll need to drill into the numbers to answer your question.

In Miranda and Kathryn's study on sugary drinks in convenience stores, it was enough to categorise the drinks using traffic lights rather than counting kilojules.  It would've been much more complex for store staff to raise the price of sugary drinks in line with the amount of sugar in them, rather than a uniform increase across a range of bad-for-you drinks.

Finally, there's always the option of collecting continuous data but using ordinal labels when you come to describe them to make your results clearer or easier to understand.

## Different types of analysis

The reason any of this matters is that we need to treat different types of data in different ways when we test it.  

We could count the number of people doing this course who own their home, but we couldn't make a very detailed analysis of the relationship between owning a home and having a Master's degree.  The best we could do would be to count and compare. We can't use the results for much other than finding out if this is happening at random.  

If instead of asking 'do you have a Master's degree' we asked 'what is you highest level of education,' we could at least find out the distribution of people who own a home and their level of education, letting us know if there's a meaningful difference.  We could try a correlation, but in this case it's unlikely to give us very precise results.

Finally, if you asked home-owner's about their yearly income and the price they paid for their dwelling, we could look at the correlation between the two on a sliding scale, with a great degree of detail.

## Your task

Take a look at [this survey](link) that we saw during _Why Experience Matters_.

Go through each question and tell us what type of data it collects.

## For those of you who like a challenge

Design a survey that will help us understand how, and how often, people exercise with no more than five questions.  

For each question, identify the type of data you're collecting.  If you use either continuous or ordinal data, explain why you made that choice.

Leave your response in the comments.
