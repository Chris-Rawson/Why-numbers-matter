# Cause, correlation or coincidence? [Discussion step]

## How do you know what causes something else, what is correlated to it and what is merely coincidence?

The short answer to that question is 'you don't often know for certain.' But there are a few things you can think about which might make you feel more confident about it.

It's commonplace knowledge that causation and correlation are not one and the same, and that some things that appear to correlate are not related at all.

A famous example of this is the work of the economist George Taylor, who developed an index in 1926 proporting to show that the length of the hem of women's dresses as depicted in fashion magazines shortened as sharemarket values were trending up, and vice-versa.  At least one researcher suggests that this remains reasonably accurate (Ahn 2015).

If this is the case, you may be able to rationally justify the proposition that prevalent economic conditions play a role in fashion trends. But it is more difficult to imagine that the mean length of hemlines in fashion magazines has much of an impact on the stock market's rise and fall.

### Causation, correlation and coincide

To disentangle cause from correlation and coincidence, we need to take a step back and think about what we mean by those terms.

__A cause__ essentially means either that something will or won't happen unless certain conditions are met.  A cause is something that either _will_ happen: what comes up must come down.  Or, it _won't happen unless_ something else does: you can't start a fire without a spark, even if not every spark spreads into a fire.

__Correlation__, on the other hand, means that two things vary together because one variable is dependent on another: the likelihood that you'll buy one product over another may depend on well the product's ads have worked on you.  Correlations make something more likely to happen, but don't they're not _neccessary_ to make something happen: you might've bought that product anyway.

__Coincidence__ happens when things vary together, but have no influence over the likelihood of either thing happening.  Coincidences [make for good stories](https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/489/no-coincidence-no-story), but they're not very useful for explaining why something happens.

### How to differentiate 

The are ocassionally cases where it's hard to tell if something really depends on something else but the majority of the time, breaking down the variables and thinking through each rationally is enough. There are a few strategies that can help you do so.

* __Timelines:__  What's happened in the past can affect the present or future, but not the other way around: your relationship with your spouse might be affected by your parents relationship when you were a child, but clearly it doesn't work in reverse. 

* __Changability:__ If one variable is very difficult, or never, changes it's more likely to be a cause than an effect.  The family you were born into [might impact on your future prosperity](https://hub.jhu.edu/2014/06/02/karl-alexander-long-shadow-research/), or your gender could play a part in determining your earning potential.  This also works if we think about things that are _harder_ to change than others.  For example, the political party you support might impact on where you source your news content from which then reaffirms your original support (Iyengar & Hahn 2009).  

* __Controls:__ If you're able to control all the relevant variables in an environment, you can often distinguish between cause and effect with great certainty. Controls as discussed in [Step 1.11, Controlled environments](link).


## Mapping relationships

One of the best ways to make a judgment call about whether something is a cause or an effect is to make a diagram of a set of propositions (Balnaves & Caputi 2001).  This will allow you to figure out if something depends on something else.

Have a look at the following statement, which has been adapted from Balnaves & Caputi (2001):

_Innovative educational institutions can be considered as a kind of rhizome; they reach out in and explore in all directions, making partnerships with others and work in an interconnected way that eschews heirarchical distinctions.  It's main goal is finding new avenues to growth, and hence its innovation.
