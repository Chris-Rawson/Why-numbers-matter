# Cause, correlation or coincidence? [Cut down word count, revise your task]

## How do you know what causes something else, what is correlated to it and what is merely coincidence?

It's commonplace knowledge that correlation is not causation, and that what looks like a corelation can turn out to be a co-incidence.

A famous example is the hemline index, developed by economist George Taylor in 1926.  It showed a that women's skirts in fashion magazines got shorter as the sharemarket picked up, and vice-versa. the length of the hem of women's dresses as depicted in fashion magazines shortened as sharemarket values were trending up, and vice-versa. 

You can see how economic conditions might play a role in fashion trends, but it's harder to imagine that short skirts really push up stock market prices.

### Causation, correlation and coincide

To disentangle cause from correlation and coincidence, we need to take a step back and think about what we mean by those terms.

__A cause__ essentially means either that something will or won't happen unless certain conditions are met.  A cause is something that either _will_ happen: what comes up must come down.  Or, it _won't happen unless_ something else does: you can't start a fire without a spark, even if not every spark spreads into a fire.

__Correlation__, on the other hand, means that two things vary together because one variable is dependent on another: the likelihood that you'll buy one product over another may depend on well the product's ads have worked on you.  Correlations make something more likely to happen, but don't they're not _neccessary_ to make something happen: you might've bought that product anyway.

__Coincidence__ happens when things vary together, but have no influence over the likelihood of either thing happening.  Coincidences [make for good stories](https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/489/no-coincidence-no-story), but they're not very useful for explaining why something happens.

### How to differentiate 

The are ocassionally cases where it's hard to tell if something really depends on something else but the majority of the time, breaking down the variables and thinking through each rationally is enough. There are a few quick rules that can help you.

* __Timelines:__  What's happened in the past can affect the present or future, but not the other way around: your marriage might be more likely to end in divorce if your parents' did, but obviously that can't work the same way in reverse.

* __Changability:__ If one variable is harder to change than another, it's more likely to be a cause than an effect.  The family you were born into [might impact on your future prosperity](https://hub.jhu.edu/2014/06/02/karl-alexander-long-shadow-research/), or your gender could play a part in determining your earning potential. Or the political party you support might impact on where you source your news content from which then reaffirms your original support (Iyengar & Hahn 2009).  

* __Controls:__ If you're able to control all the relevant variables in an environment, you can often distinguish between cause and effect with great certainty. Controls as discussed in [Step 1.11, Controlled environments](link).

* __Strength of the correlation:__ a strong correlation may be an indication of a cause/effect relationship.  We'll take a look at this in the next step.


## Mapping relationships

Things can get complex quickly.  When that happens, one of the best ways to make a judgment call about something is a cause or an effect is to make a diagram of a set of propositions (Balnaves & Caputi 2001).  This will allow you to visualise the relationships individually.

Have a look at the following statement:

_Innovative educational institutions can be considered as a kind of rhizome; they reach out in and explore in all directions, making partnerships with others and work in an interconnected way that eschews heirarchical distinctions.  It's main goal is finding new avenues to growth, hence its innovation._
