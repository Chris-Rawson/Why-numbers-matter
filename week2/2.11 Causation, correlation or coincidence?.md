# Cause, correlation or coincidence? [Discussion step]

## How do you know what causes something else, what is correlated to it and what is merely coincidence?

The short answer to that question is 'you don't often know for certain.' But there are a few things you can think about which might make you feel more confident about it.

It's commonplace knowledge that causation and correlation are not one and the same, and that some things that appear to correlate are not related at all.

A famous example of this is the work of the economist George Taylor, who developed an index in 1926 proporting to show that the length of the hem of women's dresses as depicted in fashion magazines shortened as sharemarket values were trending up, and vice-versa.  At least one researcher suggests that this remains reasonably accurate (Ahn 2015).

If this is the case, you may be able to rationally justify the proposition that prevalent economic conditions play a role in fashion trends. But it is more difficult to imagine that the mean length of hemlines in fashion magazines has much of an impact on the stock market's rise and fall.

## Sufficient and necessary causes

Thinking about cause and effect has become so commonplace that it has been absorbed into everyday language. For that reason, it's worth stepping back and breaking it down a bit.  

A cause essentially means either that something will or won't happen unless certain conditions are met.  However, there's a difference between the two.

* Things that _will_ happen if certain conditions are sometimes called _sufficient causes_.  What goes up must come down.
* Things that _will not_ happen unless certain conditions are met are called _necessary causes_, because it's necessary for them to happen but it doesn't guarantee it.  You can't start a fire without a spark, but not every spark spreads into a fire.

## Mapping relationships

One of the best ways to make a judgment call about whether something is a cause or an effect is to make a diagram of a set of propositions (Balnaves & Caputi 2001).

Have a look at the following statement, which has been adapted from Balnaves & Caputi (2001):

_Innovative educational institutions can be considered as a kind of rhizome; they reach out in and explore in all directions, making partnerships with others and work in an interconnected way that eschews heirarchical distinctions.  It's main goal is finding new avenues to growth, and hence its innovation.

_These institutions contrast with traditonalist models, which seek to segment and manage knowledge and direction and compartmentalise both internally and externally.  As a problem is discovered, it is passed up the chain of command until someone is prepared to take responsibility to its resolution.  It's main goal is controlling the environment, which dampens any innovative agenda.
