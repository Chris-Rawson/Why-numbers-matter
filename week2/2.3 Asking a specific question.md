What makes a research question worth asking?


'Asking 'how many cars per person of driving age in your community' might not seem like such a different question to 'does having children of driving age residing in a house increase the likelihood of the household will have more cars?' 

But, as we've already seen, they give rise to enormously different kinds of research projects.

It's important to spend a bit of time getting your research question right, because _everything_ flows on from it.  It's you question that will help you figure out what you're trying to do, exactly what data to collect and how you will analyse it.  It's this that will tell you if your problem is researchable, or if there's no way you could get any closer to the answer of your question.



## Fundamentals of asking a research question

A good research question should be

* **Clear.**  Your research question needs to explain exactly what you're trying to find out in a way that is clear, coherent and easy to explain.
* **Specific.**  Make sure your research question is well focussed.  Ask 'what proportion of university students express the lack of financial earning capacity as their primary reason for leaving higher education prior to graduation?' instead of 'why do people quit university?'  
* **Researchable.** If you ask 'why do people make the decision to migrate' but don't have any migrants to ask, how are you going to find out?
* **Identifies your variables.**  In quantitative research, your question should identify exactly which variables you're intending to observe.  'Does natural window light reduce office worker's stress indices as measured by this or that standardised test' is a much better question than 'how can natural light help us to feel calm, in control and happy at work?'
* **Predict behaviour.** In order to answer your quantitative question, you've got to know when the answer is 'no.'  Your question, or hypothesis, should explicitly state what you are expecting will happen so that you can tell if it doesn't.
* **Significant.** Is your question really worth the time and effort it would take to find out the answer?


## Your task
[To revise]

Take a look at the information that the World Health Organisation provides as an [introduction to cardiovascular diseases](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/).

Based on your reading, craft a research question and post it to the comments section.

If your research question might interact or overlap with someone elses, leave a comment and discuss how you might be able to work together.
