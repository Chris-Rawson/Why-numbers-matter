What makes a research question worth asking?




It's important to spend a bit of time getting your research question right, because _everything_ flows on from it.  It's you question that will help you figure out what you're trying to do, exactly what data to collect and how you will analyse it.  It's this that will tell you if your problem is researchable, or if there's no way you could get any closer to the answer of your question.

## Fundamentals of asking a research question

A good research question should be

* **Specific.**  Ask 'what proportion of people express lack of financial earning capacity as a reason for dropping out of higher education?' instead of 'why do people quit university?'
* **Researchable** If you ask 'why do people make the decision to migrate' but don't have any migrants to ask, how are you going to find out?
* **Clear**
* **Balanced**
* **Identifies your variables**


Does your question really get to the heart of the matter? Does your hypothesis adequately explain what you are observing?

Even once we have an idea of the shape and dimensions It can take a long time to figure out exactly what question to ask.  

The first thing to do is pick up where we left off last week.
