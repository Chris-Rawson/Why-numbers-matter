The line of best fit represents the relationship between variables on your scatterplot.  It may be used to make predictions.

Let's say that the kids in the trial spent no more than 4 hours all up using the software to teach them to learn fractions. But you're so excited about the potential, you want to know what would happen in they spent 10?

If you draw a straight line, called a trend line, through the dots in your scatter plot in the direction that they seem to be headed, you could keep it going beyond the edges of your data.

You could then us it to draw a range of where a student's test scores would be if they spent 10 hours using the software.  You'd probably calculate the range using standard deviation - that's a guess, but I think I'm getting better at this.

You could do this; there's nothing stopping you.  It's just that it may not be accurate.
