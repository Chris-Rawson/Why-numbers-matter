The line of best fit represents the relationship between variables on your scatterplot.  It may be used to make predictions.

Let's say that the kids in the trial spent no more than 4 hours all up using the software to teach them to learn fractions. But you're so excited about the potential, you want to know what would happen in they spent 10?

If you draw a straight line, called a trend line, through the dots in your scatter plot in the direction that they seem to be headed, you could keep it going beyond the edges of your data.

You could then us it to draw a range of where a student's test scores would be if they spent 10 hours using the software.  You'd probably calculate the range using standard deviation - that's a guess, but I think I'm getting better at this.

You could do this; there's nothing stopping you.  It's just that it may not be accurate.





Another way to understand it is to visualise it with the help of a scatter plot.  To make one, we'd put test scores on the vertical y axis, and time on the x (convention dictates that the dependent variable should go on the y axis).  If you plotted, or put a little dot on the graph, each student's test score and the time they'd spent using the software:

* a correlation on 1 would go in a straight up in line from bottom left to top right. 
* a correlation of 0.5 would trend upwards, but not in a straight line
* a correlation of 0 would show random dots everywhere

Scatterplots of negative correlations would be a mirror image of these ones.
