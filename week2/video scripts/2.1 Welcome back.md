# Welcome back


Hello, and welcome back to week 2 of why numbers matter.
This week will be all about statistics, and what they mean for you and your community.

Statistics allow us to understand, describe and explore patterns. They help us understand the likely impact of our decisions on other people, how to make our workplaces more efficient, and how to make our communities fairer and safer places to live.  
Join us this week, and learn how, with a bit of grit and determination, everyone can use statistics to help make important decisions and understand the world around us.
