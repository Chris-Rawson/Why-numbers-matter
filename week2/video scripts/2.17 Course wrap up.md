# Course Wrap Up

Congratulations on finishing the course.  Let’s look back on what we achieved.

Why do numbers matter?  Throughout the course, we’ve met people whose lives have been improved by researchers who have looked at the numbers and figured out what they are trying to tell us.

Numerical data can help us make things more effective and efficient, improve our workplaces or our financial position, or make important decisions about our lives and careers.  But the true power of using numbers is that it can help us make decisions that will have the most positive impact on the greatest number of people.

If you felt daunted by the idea of quantitative research and statistics, we hope you’ve realised that you too are able to use numbers to help make important decisions.

Please join us in the next course, where we’ll take a closer look at ethics in research.
