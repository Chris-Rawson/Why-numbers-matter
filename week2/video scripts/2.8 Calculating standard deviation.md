# Standard Deviation Video

Chris Stevenson -


Hello everyone,

I hope you're ready to get busy with some numbers.

In this video, I'm going to step you threw calculating standard deviation.

We're going to use the free online tool Google Sheets to help you to do so.  

So, if you haven't done so already, please open a new Google Sheet.  If it's the first time you've used Google Sheets, this will require you to create a new account and log in.  Take a look at your task for further instructions about how to do this.



...you could use Google Sheets to tell you the standard deviation without the mean, but this wouldn't help you much.
