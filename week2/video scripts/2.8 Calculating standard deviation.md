# Standard Deviation Video

Chris Stevenson -


Hello everyone,

I hope you're ready to get busy with some numbers.

In this video, I'm going to step you through two different ways you can calculate your standard deviation.

We're going to use Google Sheets to help us.  Google Sheets doesn't cost anything, but if it's the first time you've used it, you will need to create an account and log in. Take a look at your task on this page for further instructions about how to do this.  

Alternatively, you could use Microsoft Excel and the process will be exactly the same.

If you haven't done so already, please open a new Google Sheet.  

Once you have a new sheet open, you'll need to put in your observations or measurements, each beneath the other in a single colmun.  I've measured the width of lemons growing on my tree out the back.  There were 42 of them.
