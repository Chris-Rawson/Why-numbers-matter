# What type of data will you collect to answer your research question? [review]

[something to tie this to averages]

There're a lot of different things that we can do with numbers and so there are different types of numerical data.  The decisions we make about which type of data to collect affects how you analyse it, and therefore your results.

Different types of data relate to your decision about how to describe and measure your problem (which relates to the question you've asked, which relates to the shape and dimensions of your problem... and so on).  

In this step, we'll define the major types of data.

![Types of data](https://github.com/Chris-Rawson/Why-numbers-matter/blob/master/typesofdata.jpg) 

Data can be __numerical__ or __categorical__.  Numerical data can be __discrete__ or __continuous__, and categorical data can be __nominal__ or __ordinal.__


## Numerical and categorical data

Numerical data represent measurements that can higher or lower than other measurements, such a the number of cigarettes a person smokes in a week, or our Body Mass Index.

Categorical data represent categories, like whether or not someone is married or their level of education. 


## Discrete and continuous data

Numerical data could be discrete or continuous.

__Discrete__ data is used for counting discrete and separate things, so it can only take certain values. For example you can have two or three children, but you can't have two and a half.

__Continuous__ data measures things can take on any value.  For example, what's your blood pressure?  

## Nominal and ordinal data

Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal.

__Nominal__ data represent things that you can count but can't order, like gender or occupation.

__Ordinal__ data can be used to put things into order, like if someone is a non, ocassional, light or heavy smoker.  A common example is survey questions asking you how strongly you feel about a statement, with options ranging from strongly disagree through to strongly agree.

## How to choose a type

The main choice that you have to make is between using continuous or ordinal data.

Do you count the number of cigarettes people smoke in a week or categorise them as light or heavy smokers?  Do you ask someone's age, or ask if they're between 45 and 54?

The answer to this question largely depends on 

* the data you have access to
* how deeply you'll need to drill into the numbers to answer your question.

In Miranda and Kathryn's study on sugary drinks in convenience stores, it was enough to categorise the drinks using traffic lights rather than counting kilojules.  It would've been an close to impossible for store owners to raise the price of sugary drinks in line with the amount of sugar in them, rather than a uniform increase across a range of bad-for-you products.

Finally, there's always the option of collecting continuous data but using ordinal labels when you come to describe them to make your results clearer or easier to understand.

## Your task

Take a look at the [Framingham Risk Score survey](https://www.mdcalc.com/framingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score) and identify the different types of data the survey is collecting.  Let us know in the comments.

Please note, this calculator can and should not be used to make a diagnosis of any kind.  If you have any concerns regarding your cardiovascular health, please seek professional medical advice.

## For those of you who like a challenge

Design a survey that will help us understand how, and how often, people exercise with no more than five questions.  

For each question, identify the type of data you're collecting.  If you use either continuous or ordinal data, explain why you made that choice.
