# What type of data will you collect to answer your research question?

There're a lot of different things that we can do with numbers and so there are different types of numerical data.  The decisions we make about about which to use will affect how you analyse it, and therefore your results.

As we've seen all throughout the course, numbers are only meaningful as a measurement. Different types of data relate to your decision about how to measure your problem (which relates to the question you've asked, which relates to the shape and dimensions of your problem... and so on).
