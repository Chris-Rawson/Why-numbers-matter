# What type of data will you collect to answer your research question? [rewrite to use heart examples]

There're a lot of different things that we can do with numbers and so there are different types of numerical data.  The decisions we make about which type of data to collect affects how you analyse it, and therefore your results.

Different types of data relate to your decision about how to describe and measure your problem (which relates to the question you've asked, which relates to the shape and dimensions of your problem... and so on).  

In this step, we'll define the major types of data.

![Types of data](https://github.com/Chris-Rawson/Why-numbers-matter/blob/master/typesofdata.jpg) 

Data can be __numerical__ or __categorical__.  Numerical data can be __discrete__ or __continuous__, and categorical data can be __nominal__ or __ordinal.__


## Numerical and categorical data

Numerical data represent measurements that can higher or lower than other measurements, such a the number of cigarettes a person smokes in a day, or our Body Mass Index.

Categorical data represent categories, like whether or not someone is married or their level of education. 


## Discrete and continuous data

Numerical data could be discrete or continuous.

__Discrete__ data is used for counting discrete and separate things, so it can only take certain values. For example you can have two or three children, but you can't have two and a half.

__Continuous__ data measures things can take on any value.  For example, what's your blood pressure?  

### Nominal and ordinal data

Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal.

__Nominal__ data represent things that you can count but can't order, like gender or occupation.

__Ordinal__ data can be used to put things into order, like if someone is a non, ocassional, light or heavy smoker.
