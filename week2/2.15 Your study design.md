It’s time to apply what you’ve learned to your research problem.  [more your tasks about decision making]

Throughout this course, you have introduced yourself to some of the most common study designs and statistical tests in quantitative research.

You've looked through how to look at the shape and dimension of your problem, and thought about different strategies and research questions that might help make a difference.  Ultimately, you've discovered that everything - _everything_ - hangs off of your choice of research hypothesis.

You considered what quantitative research can be used for, and why quantitative researchers sometimes choose to use a control group.  We then looked at some of the most common study designs in quantitative research.

You've also introduced yourself to the most common statistical techniques to help you to answer your research hypothesis.  We've looked at sampling and determining the mean and the distribution of the variables in your sample.  From this we could tell what was a relatively normal or unusual result in your sample by determing standard distribution, from which we could limit the potential for false inclusions by setting confidence intervals.

Once we knew how our the variables in our sample was distributed, we could start to figure out whether or not there was any association between them.  We then looked at the difference between cause, correlation and coincidence, and figured out how to read a correlation coefficient and p-value when you see a corellation in research.  We've also looked through fitting a line through your scatterplot to make predictions and the limitations of doing so.  

Finally, you've looked at some of the other commonly used statistical tests that might help you with your research.

And, if you were not previously acquainted with it, you've learnt a little bit about quantitative language.  By now, we hope you're fairly confident in using terms like sample, population, hypothesis, mean, standard distribution, confidence intervals, p and r values, line of best fit and dependent and independent variables.  

This shouldn't be dismissed lightly; as we learnt in _Why Experience Matters [faith pronouncement]_ learning to speak someone's language gives you great insight into the way that they think.  If that's the case, then you should be well on the road to being able to think like a quantitative researcher.
