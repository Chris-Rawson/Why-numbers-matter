A test is valid if it measures what it claims to measure.

When you present our research results to the people who matter and can help make a difference, you want to be sure that they can rely on the results.  Your results need to really demonstrate what they claim to, or else you could contribute to bad decisions being made. 

There are two main threats to the [_validity_](link to glossary) of your results. They will be less valid if you are measuring the relationship between two dependent variables, or if they vary so much from other results that you start to wonder if you've made a mistake.  You can make sure your results are valid by designing good studies.

## Internal validity

Sometimes we're not measuring the effects that we think we are.  If you measure a child's growth in height and their performance in literacy tests, we'd find a strong corellation.  But, of course, how well a child reads is not caused by how tall they are.  Both height and literacy are dependent on a child's maturity. 

It's not always as simple as this.  Imagine that you have introduced new workplace safety training for your colleagues.  If you have fewer workplace accidents is it because of the training?  If there are more, is it the training's fault?  

Your results will be [internally valid](link to glossary) if you are measuring the results of an [independent variable](link to glossary), not two things that happen to be related.  Using control groups is one of the most common and effective ways to improve the internal validity of a study. Another common method is to use a protocol, or standardised instructions to taking a particular test.  These instructions have almost always been thoroughly tested for their internal valdity.

## External validity

Sometimes you get results that are so strange that you wonder if it could possibly be true.  If you measured the average length of time people spend each day in their car to and from work and found they were behind the wheel for six hours or more, you'd probably think that a mistake has been made somewhere.  

Your results will be [externally valid] if...




External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other settings (ecological validity), other people (population validity) and over time (historical validity).

External validity can be improved by setting experiments in a more natural setting and using random sampling to select participants.

## Your task 

Scenario similar to workplace training.  Draw me a line of sight between a training session as cause and improved behaviour as an effect.  Or is that cause, effect, coincidence your task?
